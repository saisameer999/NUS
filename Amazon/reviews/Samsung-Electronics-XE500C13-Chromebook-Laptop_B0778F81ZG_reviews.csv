5.0,Buy It!,Its fast and user friendly as all get out. I have a couple more expensive laptops with larger screens I purchased a few months before this one and I hardly ever touch those anymore. I have one set up in my  home office along with a desktop mainly for looks while the other functions as a guest laptop. But the Samsung stays with me. Haha. Im a Samsung phone user and android kinda fella and I reckon until they let me down...Ima be Sam Williams on Samsung for life!
5.0,"Simple, Speedy, Does What It Needs to Do","Up until now, I've only ever used Windows computers - desktop and laptop varieties. I was always under the assumption I wouldn't like Chromebooks because I wouldn't be able to download things, but I'm happy to say I'm now a Chromebook fan."
2.0,K03US version of XE500C13 is the only version worth buying,XE500C13 versions:  S03US verses K03US
3.0,I've used this exact same model bought from a store before and was overall very happy with it,"I've been using this for over 2 months now. I've used this exact same model bought from a store before and was overall very happy with it. When that one got damaged I ordered another one online and for some reason, this one freezes multiple times a week, is temperamental when I want to turn it on and can be very slow sometimes. I use it the exact same way I used the previous one, very lightly, so I'm not sure what's the problem but it's not too bad I guess."
2.0,I really haven't used it.,This device does not support Kindle apps. Just getting that out of the way....
1.0,Issues,I recently purchased a Chromebook thru Amazon. The computer is slow and the cursor hardly moves. I didn‚Äôt order a refurbished computer but it appears this may be refurbished.
4.0,Good value,"A good value - feels very much like a laptop. Good keyboard and screen. I probably should have done more research - thought it would run all Android apps. It runs many, but not all."
5.0,Five Stars,Son is having a good time with it. Easy to use.
4.0,Pretty cool but...,"The computer is great! Lightweight, quick and if you have an android; it syncs to your phone. The only problem is that the laptop sometimes freezes up. At times mine may freeze up to five times within the hour. I just hold the power button and hit the refresh button and everything is back to normal. I would recommend it for High school and under or undergrad (if you want to push it)."
5.0,Perfect travel companion.,My first Chromebook and I am really pleased.  Does everything my desktop does.  Printing is from cloud only and wireless.  Took 2 minutes to set up and works perfectly.  Highly recommend. üòÅ
1.0,Don‚Äôt buy,"I wish I could do 0 stars. Do not buy! It‚Äôs SOOOO SLOW! The whole point of me buying this was to be faster than my 7 year old dell laptop. It wasn‚Äôt. That laptop loaded everything faster than the chrome book. And this is loading webpages, email, email attachments, documents, pictures, etc. Filling out a web form on this, forget it, I had to switch to a different device. I actually googled it and it is a thing with this chrome book. The boards say to do a couple of upgrades and speeds so pick up but they did not. Not worth the money. I bought an Acer chrome book after and it‚Äôs phenomenal. It‚Äôs actually does what it‚Äôs meant to do."
5.0,Best traveling laptop,The battery life isn't great but it'll last at least 8 hours.  The screen is a little small but it's a good size for traveling.  Love the Chromebook that is virus free.
5.0,This one is faster than his old one and has a very nice screen. The texture is nice as well,My son needed a new chromebook for school. This one is faster than his old one and has a very nice screen. The texture is nice as well
3.0,Disappointing.,"Usually the Samsung products I've had have all been as expected however, this laptop was hard to get the best angle for viewing maybe because it has a non glare screen? In addition, the quality and clarity of the screen image was mediocre. Windows OS was kinda sluggish too. I returned for a different laptop brand."
4.0,Decent for the size,"I bought this for my husband since he though our normal lap top was too big to take back in forth to college.  It‚Äôs okay, it serves its purpose but it takes a lot of getting use to.  Scrolling down a page is probably my biggest dislike with this lap top.  I would recommend getting a wireless mouse with it.  I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I have yelled at this lap top to scroll down lol.  For some reason husband can‚Äôt get the internet to work on it at the college so he is still toting the bigger one. Oh well, at least we have an extra lap top now."
4.0,... not what I thought however it's been working just fine for me,"It's not what I thought however it's been working just fine for me. I am enjoying it so far,  I recently received it so for now I am just going to give it 4 stars. It was an oversight on my part I will be keeping it because it's not bad for the price."

5.0,Great Chromebook,Battery life is excellent; processing speed is fast.  Very easy to set up.  Very satisfied overall with this Chromebook.
2.0,only good for 6 months,It worked perfectly up until a few months in. Then I noticed something wrong with the screen.  I had bought this one once before and he first time it happened I thought I did something . so I bought another one and treated it even better but the same thing happened where after a while when I went to open the screen the were black spots. it would change every time I opened the top of the Chromebook. It lasted almost exactly 6 months on both of them.
5.0,Compact and efficient,"This is perfect for classes and doesn‚Äôt take up room in my backpack so my science books can fit without a problem. The only issue is the WiFi sometimes will not pair up with my schools WiFi so I have to use my phone hotspot, but other than that a great buy."
4.0,Nice,Nice computer as long as you have wifi. Last one you could buy GB with out having wifi. My mistake for not reading everything.

2.0,compatibility problems,This one is fine if all you want to do is browse the internet and have a keyboard.  But there are way too many apps that don't work on the Chrome OS.

4.0,Great for the basics! Perfect coffee shop computer!,"This is perfect for basic work including blog posting, internet shopping, Pintrest pinning and stuff like that. Perfect for the price too.

After the holiday, I went to set them up and my sons screen was broke internally and my daughter can‚Äôt use the ‚Äú3‚Äù. This is past the return option because I planned ahead for the holiday and now I‚Äôm stuck with two expensive coasters. Don‚Äôt buy this item!!!!!"
3.0,"It‚Äôs a chromebook, but it‚Äôs old .",This wasnt what I was looking for . It doesn‚Äôt even look the same as the picture. False advertising at its best ! I needed the newest one available (like in the picture) but that‚Äôs not what I received .

5.0,Quality for a great price!,Nothing to dislike.  It's a fast chromebook and works as advertised.  Well made construction.
5.0,Pretty good buy,I was pretty happy with my purchase! I was disappointed at first thinking there was no option to right click without connecting a mouse. But a simple google search taught me all you have to do is tap the scroll pad with 2 fingers. I haven't had any other issues so far.

5.0,Five Stars,Excellent product
5.0,Solid feel with good battery life.,"This is my first chromebook and for its intended purpose of checking e-mail, web browsing, and working with google productivity apps it has been perfect.  There are a few quirks to chrome OS that take some getting used to and I would not consider this an adequate replacement for a PC.  Speed is just fine, I have not noticed any significant lag, but I also have not used it for anything very taxing. The device itself has a quality feel.  It is lightweight but does not feel flimsy there is no flex in the screen or body when opening.  The keyboard is adequate though somewhat cramped.  The screen is adequately bright and looks nice straight on.  Off axis viewing is not great, colors tend to fade when viewed from more than about 30 degrees.  I haven't really measured the battery life, but with occasional use it can go multiple days between charges.  For the price I paid on Prime Day I am extremely pleased with this device.  It has almost completely replaced my tablet."
5.0,"We use for ROBLOX, Amazon Prime movies, shopping, fantasy football and more","I am not an electronic expert at all. I purchased this on Amazon prime day since our home laptop is 12 years old and wasn‚Äôt supporting the kids at school. It‚Äôs our first chrome book. We love it , my husband and two boys. My kids play ROBLOX on it and a few other games. I use for amazon shopping. My husband use for his fantasy football. We use to watch Amazon Prime movies when we are at the beach (no cable) each weekend. So far it‚Äôs held a pretty good battery life. Also it connects to WiFi great. When we are in the RV at the beach we use our wireless hotspots and Verizon jet pack for WiFi. After we put the password for each network in once it automatically connects to whatever four networks we use. I highly recommend. Will probably be purchasing another one for Christmas so each kid can have his own or when they both need co outer at same time for school work. We love it."
3.0,Chrome Book that defaults to other browser pain in the rear.,Bought my second Samsung Chromebook. This new one automatically goes to a web browser other than Google when I open a new search page making it necessary to click on the Google icon. I have eliminated all other browsers using the settings menu but the problem persists even after re-starting. Could it be that Samsung was paid a fee  for this bug?
5.0,Great computer for the money!,"I bought one for my son to do schoolwork on a few months ago. I was constantly borrowing it, so decided to buy my own plus three more for gifts. Everyone has absolutely loved theirs. The small size is easy to handle. Terrific battery life. No issues with freezing up. We dont use them for gaming, mostly school, research and email correspondence."

1.0,Just awful,Useless junk even for a cheap chomebook!
1.0,very disappointing,"Very disappointing should have returned it immediately.  Freezes without any apparent reason, wouldn't accept numbers in a password,  launch flashed continuously.  Samsung tech recommended power wash which was done problem returned after few days .  Too late to return to Amazon will try Samsung directly"
