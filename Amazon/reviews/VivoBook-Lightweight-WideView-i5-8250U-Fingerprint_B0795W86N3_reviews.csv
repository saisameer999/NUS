1.0,Even the replacement is defective! Buyer beware :(,"After years of using Amazon for hundreds of orders, this is my very FIRST negative review:"
5.0,Best value for the money,I've had the Vivobook for a week. I love this machine. I have hhr combined SSD and 1 TB HD. I did my research on the specs and this is the best value I could find for the money.
5.0,Great Laptop! Thankfully I read the comment section for amazing advice!,"Wife and I were looking for a solid at home laptop that can be used for work if necessary. Saw this was Amazon's Choice and popular laptop. After reading the reviews and recommendations, bought Crucial 8GB Single DDR4 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) DR x8 Unbuffered SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - CT8G4SFD824A. This is a quick laptop and thankful for all the helpful recommendations."
1.0,Horrible way to run a company so I returned the ...,Volume was not working. I called Asus support 2 days after receiving my laptop. They said I probably needed to add some additional drivers or get some driver updates. They would help me only if I bought an ongoing support contract with them. I refused. Told them I had it for 2 days and it is a brand new machine and that they should support it. Their answer was that because I bought it from Amazon it was not their problem. They would have done it for me at no cost if I had bought the laptop directly from Asus. Horrible way to run a company so I returned the item and am looking at hp laptops.
4.0,Solid laptop with one major flaw,"Nothing to say that hasn't already been covered by those reviewers far more knowledgeable than I other than the keyboard was designed by a total sociopath. No, this is not an exaggeration. A sociopath."
1.0,Faulty after 2 weeks: Not charging,"I purchased this laptop on the 11th of June 2018 and today is the 25th, which means I have had it for just about 2 weeks."
5.0,This computer is great. I am very satisfied with it and i ...,"This computer is great. I am very satisfied with it and i would definitely recommend it, especially for the price!"
1.0,Don't believe Everything You Read.  Do you research......,"Within the first few days of getting used to my laptop the monitor died and I had to send it back to ASUS.  ASUS customer support was through CHAT and cumbersome.  After a week, they sent my computer back to the wrong address and it was ridiculously complicated to finally get the laptop back."
5.0,Thoughts on this Asus VivoBook,I ordered the version that comes with a 128 SSD hard drive pre-installed because I don't feel comfortable taking apart a laptop and installing things myself. So far I'm very happy with it.
4.0,High guality machine for a great price.,"I've owned this laptop for a week. The laptop is as advertised. The screen display is great, the laptop is very thin and light, easily fits into my bookbag at 15.6"". It came with 128 GB SSD and a 1 TB HDD drive. The Intel Core i5-8250U is awesome; although, I think I would be a little more comfortable with 16 gb of ram and a little more solid state storage (256ish) to make it run just a tad faster, but I can't complain at all for the cost. I haven't done anything too strenuous, but I like to have a little extra room for hardcore multitasking and/or gaming since I'll be starting graduate school in a few days. Windows 10 feels fresh with their updates. Heck, I might even use Edge. Just kidding. I love is the fingerprint scanner. This is my first laptop with a fingerprint scanner, and on this ASUS it's very fast so that is convenient. The laptop has been very quiet, and hasn't heated up on me yet. It feels very nice holding it in my lap because there is plenty of space for the palms of your hands to rest while you type if you're leaning back."
5.0,"Portable... 15.6, SSD, 8th gen i5.. This is it","This computer is fantastic.  I did a lot of researching looking for laptops in varying sizes (13.3, 15.6, 17.3).  I was looking for an SSD and i5 8th gen CPU, and at a great price.  After arrival this computer easily beat my expectations.  The computer is super fast (thanks SSD) and has no problem running large excel spreadsheets and access files.  I looked at more expensive laptops and almost pulled the trigger on the $750 Zenbook.  I'm more than happy with this ""Cheaper"" alternative that all of my needs.  SSD, 8th gen i5 CPU..  Laptop is super light and slim too which makes it ultra portable"
1.0,No backlit keyboard and screen isnt very bright!,"I have had issues since day one. Ive had for almost a week and enough is enough. On day one, I had been using it for maybe 2 hours and it randomly shut off. I had it on my desk and was watching youtube videos and it went black. I was able to turn it back. I didn't want to think to much into it and just wrote it off.  Then the next day, same thing, screen goes black and it dies. It has happened a total of 5 times in 5 days. Im returning it. Maybe I got a dud, but I don't want another Asus laptop. I will constantly be thinking about how it will probably fall apart in a few moths. Think its best to return and buy Samsung. Aside from that, laptop seems fine. The screen is very dim however. Feel like at max brightness it just isn't enough. No backlit keyboard is kinda a bummer but I digress. The issue is that I got a faulty laptop and that's why the negative review."
5.0,and I am very happy with it so far,"I just got my new laptop in the mail last night, and I am very happy with it so far. I read the reviews before I bought it, and I think a lot of the reviewers bought the version of this computer with just the regular hard drive. I sprung the extra ~$90 for the 128 gb sold state hard drive.  When I plugged in and started the new computer up, I found it was very fast.  So far everything is working very well, and I am happy with it. For this budget price, I think this is really an excellent buy!"
4.0,Overall a solid performer and doesn't feel cheap,"I'm very satisfied with this laptop. Being so thin and so light, yet is has a build quality that I think rivals others in the price range. An 8th Generation Intel i5, 8GB of RAM, and a 1080p display that's vivid and crisp, paired with speakers that aren't that bad and chiclet keyboard that's responsive?"
1.0,Asus Black Screen of Death (Update),"This is an update of my initial review below.  My Asus Vivobook worked great for exactly four months, until May 15, when I got the Asus Black Screen of Death.  I've had many laptops, tried everything I know to revive it, but this laptop is completely dead after four months of service."
1.0,I thought it was a bad hdmi connection,The laptop seems okay until I tried to connect an external monitor via hdmi. The screen flashes for a second every 30 seconds or so.
1.0,Damn!!! Brand New ASUS VivoBook Won't Work!,"I spent months researching and reading reviews to get a new laptop in the $500-$600 range. I went with the ASUS Vivobook based on the good specs, better HDD and RAM, reviews, and because I could pay for it over several months. Now I just got the laptop yesterday. Today, I went through the initial install and went to download Google Chrome on my Brand New ASUS VivoBook. Everything was fine and I went out for an hour. Then when I came back NOTHING!! The power button turns on but the laptop screen Just Stays Black. Tried a hard reboot. Still Nothing."
3.0,good performance laptop with bad keyboard layout,"Cons - NO light to indicate Caps lock. Delete and Power button too close to each other and looks the same, I accidentally pressed the power button couple of times."
1.0,"Well, I was warned. Disspaointed.","This laptop is beautiful, and that's about it. It was to be a gift. I set it up and installed a background and pw since I'd be flying with it, and that's all. It was fully charged and I only turned it on a total of 3 times before the screen went blank. I didnt download any programs whatsoever. First time was to set it up and make sure it worked. Second was to show a friend (at which point I noticed it took s little long to boot up and response time was slow) and third was yesterday as my flight departs in a few days, to make sure everything was good"
4.0,Great battery life and very responsive system.,"Absolutely love this laptop. Fast boot, runs for 8+ hours on battery. Use for CCTV MANAGEMENT, Sage Accounting Software. No backlit keys but keyboard is sturdy built. Uses ssd for OS and apps and HDD for data. Highly recommend. This unit does not come with an Ethernet port."
1.0,Asus no longer my laptop of choice,"I have owned 3 Asus laptops and the first 2 were really great. I purchased my third in October of 2018 and it's already dead. I have used it 2 dozen times and when I opened it to work 2 days ago, the battery hadn't been charging. Today, I tried several things to get it to start charging again, including a chat with Asus support. After 1 1/2 hours of chat, they couldn't help me fix it. I started a very long process to return for repair.  BTW: If you do choose to chat with Asus support be advised it will take a VERY LONG TIME. I think they take multiple chats at once and keep you holding forever.  I am completely bummed and despite returning this unit for repair, I will most likely buy another brand altogether. I've attached images of the condition the laptop is in at the time of return. The support person mentioned something about the laptop being in it's original condition, and I don't want there to be any misunderstandings. This laptop has been used very little, and has not been damaged in any way."
4.0,Well worth it!,First is all this is a great laptop. I got it for $569.99 which made it a good price for all the specs that you get.
4.0,"Arrived in good condition, on time","Pro: High capacity internal HDD (1 TB), does not heat up after prolonged use, OS is on an SSD=ready to use in a heartbeat; lightweight."
5.0,Desktop Replacement,"I have a Sony Vaio that is going on ten years old - purchased in February of 2009. It's a very good PC, and has been my constant travel companion. So, it's beat up. It's got a 320GB HDD, a bluray player which no longer works because the s/w theft software is obsolete, and the thing is literally falling apart. For $1600, I've definitely gotten my money's worth."
5.0,"SSD version: fast, lightweight, great for light gaming",DISCLOSURE: laptop I had before this Asus was a 6-year-old poor quality Lenovo that I spent almost $1000 on in 2013. TBH I could have bought a $300 laptop and it'd probably be faster and feel more premium than my old Lenovo.
4.0,Value for money with one nice surprise,"I suppose I would rate this at 3-1/2 stars if I had the option, but it's a 4 rather than 3 mainly because it includes a TPM chip that was not advertised. That is a huge bonus for me. And after the great warranty experience, 4 stars is what it should be."
1.0,DONT PURCHASE ! Very Disgruntled + ANGRY !!,"LOOKS GOOD BUT NO GOOD !! Doesnt even deserve 1 star !!!. I ordered this laptop in Oct 2018 In prep for my online studies which started last week. Turned on the Pc to start charging and personalizing email set up and after 10 mins in the middle od set up, The screen went blank witbout any warning. Funny that I could still hear email notifications while the screen remained blank..It never came back on.. I turned the lap top on and off a few times to get it to restart and still nothing. Finally took it to a specialist today to get it checked out and now being told "" BAD NEWS "" your PC have Motherboard Issues ?? Like seriously ??. What is worst , I live in the Caribbean and had a 3rd party bring my order to me from my Us mailing address  !! I DO NOT have the luxury of returning items free of charge and I need my laptop to study !!! AMAZON PLEASE HELP !! HELP !! HELP !!"
4.0,pretty decent basic laptop,I wanted to try this out given the price and the fact it does have the quad core i5 processor.  It really is a big step up in performance.
5.0,Good value for money.,What I like about it is that having a Solid State Drive means that starts quickly and having 8GB RAM means that it operates fast even when numerous programs are running and when memory hungry programs are running. What is a minor issue is that the fairly heavy power supply plugs directly into the power point meaning that the extra weight can cause the power supply to come loose easily. It would be better to have a short cord between the plug and the power supply so that this looseness doesn't happen.
4.0,"Good performance, portability, display and wifi","Good performance, portability, display and wifi"
5.0,So far...,So good. I really can't find anything to complain about except for the lack of DVD drive but the after market plug in devices are very affordable if you need one and I knew that when I bought it. I like that it's Bluetooth so I was able to connect my JBL Charge 3 to it. The speakers on the laptop are superb anyway. I use my laptop to produce videos from my Cyberlink software and have had zero issues with lag time or producing. Good product overall.
5.0,"Really great laptop, 100% buy if looking for a powerful, sleek looking and affordable laptop","I'd say the best affordable laptop out there: powerful, fast, sleek looking and perfect in every aspect. Bought the one with an ssd included, this laptop is awesome for work, couldn't be more happy."
1.0,Super low sound and stutters on 10 year old game. C'mon.,"I'm amazed how bad this machine is for the money, and for being described as a ""mid-level gamer."" The display is less sharp than my Kindle fire HD10, by a long shot. The audio is almost impossible to hear. It is slow to do everything. Here's the kicker: it is doing a terrible job running Dragon Age. Yes. It stutters on a 10 year old game. The last laptop I bought from Walmart cost me $450 and this one is not as good, except for being very thin. The form factor is nice, but the power key is in the upper right, easy to hit when using backspac nor page up. Don't buy this machine. Thanks Amazon for your great return policy!!!"
4.0,Good Computer for Your Buck,"I was nervous to buy this after the reviews were so low, but I've liked it. I don't know why everyone is complaining about it. So what if it doesn't have a backlit keyboard? I have one on my other computer, and I've permanently disabled it because it was annoying me so much. This computer is fine. I upgraded from my old laptop that was almost five years old. This computer was amazing compared to that one. It's fast and it's quiet. I use it for business purposes, like work. I also use it for Word Documents and basic web surfing. I'm assuming most people you rated this so low wanted a fancy gaming computer. This is a not a gaming computer. It's a quiet and basic computer for basic tasks. It works great for what I need it to do."
4.0,Lightweight.  Fast.  A little bit difficult to set up at first.,I've had this laptop for a couple of weeks now (not much has changed)...  Here are my pros and cons:
5.0,Solid Laptop At a Reasonable Price,"I've only had this Laptop for a little over a week so I can't speak for it's long term durability but so far it's a solid machine. I use my Laptop for Some music production (Cubase 10 paired with an Akai MPK Mini), moderate gaming on low settings (Starcraft 2), and your general social media and MS office applications and even with just 8MB of memory this guy handles everything I need like a champ.  This is my first experience with an SSD, I got the 128MB + standard storage, and I'm impressed. I'd have to wait to see its long term reliability to see if I'd buy it again, but so far so good."
3.0,Install malware and scan for viruses immediately before using,super thin - love the color - had to completely remove the operating system though - too many viruses already on the computer when received - had to get my own operating system and re- install everything
4.0,This is a great laptop that boots and is logged on in under ...,"This is a great laptop that boots and is logged on in under eight seconds (if you use the fingerprint scanner) and launches apps lightning-fast.  Battery life is four hours. Cons are that the keyboard is not back-lit, there is little key travel, there is no physical indication that caps lock is on and there is no number pad. If you don't mind those things, put some serious thought into buying this laptop."
4.0,Solid For Budget Buy,"Alright, so I rarely write reviews on my orders but this was a must.  I definitely should have looked more into the minimal details before purchasing this laptop but don't let that deter you.  From open to setup it ran pretty smoothly - including a restart after installing all of my used program and erasing all the pre-installed nonsense that comes with it.  My biggest issue is the lack of a back lit keyboard for this budget of a laptop it 100% could have had one installed as well as no indication on caps lock being on or off.  That is tremendously frustrating but I should have done better due diligence prior to purchase.  Did a fair amount of research prior to purchase and being someone who knows his way around a computer fairly well this was the best buy for the budget.  You can upgrade to additional M.2 / RAM / HDD which is a bonus (OH! you 100% want to get the SSD version Esp. if you're going to running adobe creative cloud and battle.net."
4.0,Not bad. Disappointing volume.,"This is the second Asus I've purchased. It's smaller than my first one, but still good. I don't know how much I like the keyboard being only slightly raised, but that's just me. It gets my passwords wrong a lot, and if you have nails, the sound of them on the plastic can be annoying. It's pretty fast, but I also don't have any storage used up on it just yet. What I'm really not liking so far is the volume. I thought my old laptop was quiet, but this one is even worse. It really does not have much for volume at all. I have speakers I can bluetooth to, but even just watching a movie trailer loud enough for a few people to hear was difficult. Forewarning. Otherwise, so far, everything else is just fine."
4.0,- Very good looking. - Super light - Excellent screen quality,Pros:
5.0,Worth it,"I used to have a Mac before this and, due to unforeseen circumstances, had died. So, ya boi is poor and couldn't afford a Mac so I got a this PC and I just gotta say that this was one of the better decisions I've made because the SSD is just refreshing (boots up so much faster), it runs all of the academic and gaming programs I have smoothly, and honestly the price is genuinely good for the product that I got. I highly recommend this computer (that one of my friends actually told me to get!) because it's treated me really well! ^-^"
4.0,"Laptop is well built, fast yet I initially received a damaged product","Overall, the laptop has a solid feel to it. The keys are easy to type on and the laptop itself is thin yet feels solid and well constructed. The hardware inside is more than enough for my Mother who uses it for Word, Excel, and viewing pictures from her SD cards. This is a well constructed and powerful laptop that is perfect for everyday use as well as some otherwise intensive task such as large spreadsheets or presentations."
4.0,Had this laptop for a month and I love it. I bought the one with a SSD ...,"Had this laptop for a month and I love it.  I bought the one with a SSD drive and it makes a world of difference.  My last Asus lasted me 5 good years so I decided to stick with them.  I waited for the price to drop so I could also buy 8 GB of ram.  I just use this laptop for basic stuff, so no gaming or video editing.  I highly suggest getting a SSD drive.  I'm never going back to HDD after this.  I just wished the SSD drive was bigger than 128 GB.  I only have 30 GB left from all the applications I've installed.  I'm also happy that got rid of the CD drive.  I haven't used a CD in ages.  This allows it to be smaller and it fits perfectly in my backpack.  Would definitely recommend."
5.0,Asus laptop give excellent experiences.,"Other than backlit keyboard, every other specs are very satisfactory with this price.. Screen is very crisp and CPU speed is very fast. Furthermore, the thickness of PC is also very ergonomic for typing.  I am using 3 asus laptop. Overall, Asus laptop give excellent experiences..^^"
5.0,Great Computer - Worst Speakers,"I bought this computer to help me through school as I pursue a degree in programming. The computery part has been great. It processes pretty quickly, I don't have any issues using multiple programs at once, and it doesn't freeze up on me. As a reminder though, it doesn't have a backlit keyboard, which I typically like to have but this was such a good deal that I didn't mind not having one. The speakers, however, are AWFUL. I would rather them not work at all than to deliver the paltry volume it can eek out. Unless I am in a completely quiet room and am close enough to touch it, this laptop's audio ability is moot (get it?). If you don't mind always using earbuds or a bluetooth speaker for any audio, than this is a good buy. Otherwise, keep looking!"
4.0,Happy so far,"Only had for a couple months or so but it has done everything I have asked of it. I don't have big demands, just basic computing, internet, light Photoshop and 3-d modeling with CAD and sketchup. Everything is working good and this laptop is quick compared to others I have had. Biggest complaints, there is no light that comes on when you hit caps lock so I am always using trial and error when typing passwords, and the keyboard keys feel kinda sloppy."
5.0,sadly.. 6 months later,"Drifted away from using laptops and desktops toward tablets for about 5 years. Then I needed a device that works with programs not apps, and I also needed to be able to handle lots of photos. After considerable searching and digging around I chose the Vivobook i5 F510U with both the SSD and 1TBHDD. Simply put, it has been a joy using it. It's so fast. It also charges much faster than my tablets did. And I'm enjoying not having to balance it on my lap to use it, rather sitting at a table.  I added blue stacks so that I could still access certain apps. It's all moving along really well."
4.0,"Good specs for the price, small but annoying lack of features","Firstly, for your money you will have a hard time finding a laptop with these specs and a 1920x1080 display. That being said there are some small features, or lack there of, which may disappoint you. No backlit keyboard, excluding the power button.. Honestly, why? How the hell are you not going to put a light under the caps, num, and scroll lock in 2018??? Also, I hope you dont need to press the 'alt' key often because youre probably going to get annoyed by how often you press the windows key instead, which you cannot lock or disable (easily at least)."
3.0,Not a good buy,Sounds like a good deal for a $620 laptop but battery doesn't perform as promised I am hardly getting 4 hrs. It doesn't has backlit keyboard:( typing in low light is such a pain. For an 15.6 inch laptop it appears fragile the keyboard itself feels like the keys will pop out. Overall will not recommend you can get far better laptops for the price range. Sad that I can't return this one.
4.0,"Great Computer, webcam... not so much.","I needed a newer computer, since I decided to continue my Bachelors after more than 10 years. My old Toshiba just wasn't up to the task. after quite a bit of research, I decided on the ASUS VivoBook with the SSD already inserted. I've watched videos of installation, but just didn't feel comfortable trying to do it and not mess up by brand new computer."
4.0,Light-weight and big screen,"Good buy! It would be nice if this model had the backlit keyboard. Without the SSD, maybe it's not so good (when i access the HHD too much it's kind of slowish, plus it gets a little warm where the right hand sits). It's vere light."
5.0,A powerful and beautiful laptop for home use and light office work,"Asus has created amazing laptop for this price point. The body is plastic, but isn't cheap-looking. Rather, I find laptop beautiful. Non-metal body reduces the weight of laptop making it so much easier to hold or carry around. The screen is nice and bright, no issues there. Pretty good for all media consumption."
5.0,LOVE IT,"It doesn't have a DVD/CD player. I didn't notice this when I bought it but that's okay. I thought it would bug me but not really. Probably helps I still have my old ASUS model that does have one, though. I think this is the perfect computer for school, etc. It is small and light which I love. It moves very quickly and loads up everything pretty fast. I really enjoy the display it is a very clear picture quality. So far I am very satisfied. I love ASUS products"
5.0,Good performance and speed!,"I bought this laptop to replace my 9 yr old MacBook (which I loved).  I was hesitant with my purchase at first, but quickly came to love the Vivobook.  It is user friendly.  Set up was a breeze.  I had no issues customizing it to my individual needs and preferences.  If you have any questions the laptop has an e-manual installed.  Other reviews mentioned not liking the power button location but I don't mind it at all.  I have never accidentally turned it off.  If you need an affordable, thin, portable, fast laptop then look no further.  This little machine really delivers!"
5.0,Perfect Family Laptop,"I poured over reviews of various manufacturer laptops and eventually settled on this Asus. Previously, I had an Asus and the only trouble I had with it was that the battery stopped charging. This particular model is perfect for my family. I love the fingerprint recognition, and the computer itself is very fast, including internet surfing, and is able to handle videos. It's also compact and very lightweight and transfers on the go easily. The battery life is good though not as good as other manufacturers.  Like other reviewers here, the sound quality could use a volume boost in the next model, but with some tweaking of the controls, it does get better. Still not great. Also, the keyboard isn't backlit, but it works for my family. We don't need that feature. Other reviewers are also correct about the power button being directly next to delete. No idea why they designed it this way. I haven't accidentally turned off the computer while going for delete, but I see how it's possible given the button location. In the short time we have had this laptop, it has been great for everyone in my family. The price was great and I especially like being able to pay for this in 4 month installments. I highly recommend this for anyone who needs a device for general everyday use."
1.0,GARBAGE,Received the laptop and was working fine but the screen turned completely black after 5 minutes and would not turn back to normal. COMPLETE EFFING GARBAGE.
3.0,I miss having a cd/dvd drive. Volume is very weak,"I wish I had noticed that there is no cd/dvd drive! That makes it harder to work with. I’ve been trying to get it to pull my photos and music off my iphone and even after various tries done wirelessly and with USB nothing works. I don’t think it’s the computer. I don’t like Windows 10 so far but I have only worked with it a little bit. Hopefully I’ll get better at it. Just the same, I’m sending my old ASUS in to get repaired. It runs on Windows 7 and I understand it. And it actually has chess! So far I can’t use this for listening to music. It badly needs outboard speakers or something. Very low volume. Maybe I will find a way to increase it. It is on100% on the screen."
5.0,Great so far!,"Great deal! Fast, no issues so far! The aesthetics are good too, very sleek, slim, and sexy!  The resolution isn't as good as I was hoping, but I guess I'd have to invest more to obtain that degree of perfection.  I am also comparing it to my gaming desktop...which was more than twice the price."
1.0,don't buy this! I regret!,I have been using this for just 3 months. I always had HP in the past (at least 4 different models and way cheaper of this Asus) and never had issues even after years of intense using.
5.0,Great laptop for the price (must get SSD combo),"Have had the laptop now for about a week and love it. Use it for browsing, listening to music, programming, and school work. The look and feel remind me a lot of my old 2011 Macbook Pro. If you're going to get this laptop, you absolutely must pay the extra cost for the SSD combo as that what makes this a really good deal."
5.0,Great Value & Quality for the Price!,"This is an excellent laptop for the price.  For the money, the speed and versatility of this computer is really great.  I added anti-virus software and purchased MS Office Home 365 to complete the package for my needs.  Very happy with the updated ASUS features.  It beats the Dell and HP laptops on price and the quality,  This is my second ASUS laptop and I highly recommend this product."
4.0,Good deal,Good laptop. It opens quickly. Amazon packaging was not good. Laptop wasn't stable inside the box hopefully working great. Don't use onedrive option it wastes %25 of your cpu power. If you open it just close it.
5.0,Good price for upgrading RAM,I bought this for my wife. We had been price shopping around for a laptop with 32g of ram. We decided on buying this laptop since its price point was nice and getting two 16g sticks for it.
4.0,Great laptop,"The Asus VivoBook is a very good laptop. Once setup was finished, which only took 15 minutes, it booted up in 6 seconds flat. The processing speed is blazing fast compared to my 6 year old Dell Inspiron."
1.0,Display died after one week,"Buyer beware, this laptop ""deal"" lasted one week of use.  I only installed MS Office and Quickbooks 2019.  I left the laptop open (where it went to sleep) only to return to a dead screen, never to return. Very disappointed since I was only using as a replacement laptop for a small consulting business.  After researching possible issues and solutions, this laptop is known for displays dying.  Hence, I am having to return to ASUS for repair.  I should have listened to my gut and not ordered from Amazon.  I always get burned buying discounted knock offs or expired goods from Amazon.  Shame on me."
2.0,Great buy for the price doesn’t work long.,"DONT BE FOOLED!!!!!! This laptop is NOT a touch screen! But it is a great laptop and perfect for my purpose. I use this for photo editing with Lightroom, photoshop, camera raw, and illustrator. The computer moves so fast on these programs while still letting me internet surf in the background. Battery life is great for this but my son plays the news sims on my computer and gaming KILLS the battery. I could edit photos for hours but when he plays his game the battery last maybe 2 hours max. HOWEVER! After about 3 months the laptop slowed down and the screen stopped working. Now I’m left without a laptop for work and school while I wait for it to be “repaired”"
5.0,Can someone fall in love with a Laptop?,"I am truly enjoying this laptop. The only drawback (a small one) is that it does not have a port for attaching a wire for internet connection. The wireless connection works just fine, but when I am at my desk, I would have liked to hook it up for a faster better experience online."
5.0,"Great laptop so far, it feels more lightweight than I expected, which I love!!","Nice, lightweight laptop. This new laptop was packed well and is in great condition. No scratches or anything sticking out of the laptop as some other reviews have mentioned. Initial setup was super easy. I will use this for internet surfing, watching videos, creating and updating documents via Microsoft Office and maybe some games. I will update this review as I start to use it or if I encounter any issues or errors."
5.0,may be the best value Windows laptop,"I've had this laptop for a little over a month and love it - no unpleasant surprises thus far.  Absolutely silent due to the SSD, plenty fast enough with the I5 chip and 8 Gb of RAM, monitor clear and bright, very good battery life, light in weight yet seems to be quite tough.  My only disappointment would be the keyboard, which is adequate but nothing special.  I expect little in sound quality in a laptop so am satisfied with the sound of this one.  Excellent value, highly recommended."
2.0,Way too slow for the money and the screen is nothing special at all,"Very disappointed in how slow it seems. I guess that it is ok. Keyboard and mouse pad seem fine, but overall it seems strangely SLOW. Plus the screen is bland."
4.0,Fast and great quality for the price,This is a fast and good quality laptop for ~600$
1.0,Beware....,"I have had this laptop for about a month. Yesterday the backlight went out. It was brand new out of the box, I've never dropped it. I've honestly ever used it a couple of times. Now I have to deal with warranty stuff and sending it back etc...."
5.0,but so far I love it. I needed a new computer because the ...,"So I just got this laptop this month, so it's still early on, but so far I love it. I needed a new computer because the screen on my old one was on the fritz, making me not exactly want to use it. It's amazing having a fully functioning laptop again. The setup on this is easy to do, they even walk you right through it. It's really quick (especially compared to my old one) and I'm loving the fingerprint scanner. I realized a few days into using it that it doesn't have a number pad like my old one, but I'm accommodating to get around that- it was mostly the minus key I'm missing so I can quickly add things like em dashes while I'm typing in Word. So far so good. I'm so happy I went with this laptop versus any others I had been looking at. I may be developing a brand loyalty here; my old laptop was Asus, too, and it lasted me quite some time."
5.0,Great for play or work,"I bought for work and with the addition of standard applications, it is a great traveling computer for a consultant.  The Solid State Drive really allow for a fast boot while the traditional spinning drive provides great storage for archival-type data.  Love it."
1.0,My Honest Review - Know Before You Buy!,***UPDATE*** Three weeks after I purchased this laptop it died. The power button turns on but the screen is black. I called Asus and they told me it was a hardware issue and to return the laptop. They didn’t seem surprised at all as if this happens all the time. I’m disappointed as I had high hopes for this laptop. I definitely don’t recommend.
5.0,Speedy with the SSD,"I read the recommendations to get this PC with the SSD for fast bootups/shutdowns.  I also added 8G of additional Crucial RAM to the 16G existing to bring it up to 24G out of a possible 32G.  (Note from Crucial:  put the larger stick in Slot 0).  For what I do, Lightroom photo editing, web surfing, this laptop's a winner.  The display is sharp.  It's very lightweight and will easily get stashed in my camera bag on those overseas trips."
4.0,Pretty good!,"I bought this to replace a bare-bones, cheap-as-dirt little 11 inch laptop, as the old machine was both extremely slow and extremely small. So far I have been very pleased with this purchase. I am not particularly demanding of it - basic web surfing and quite a bit of work in the Google suite of office products and Microsoft Office - but it is more than up to the task of multiple open tabs, documents and spreadsheets without any lag or sluggishness. It did not seem to be bogged down with a lot of bloatware either, which I appreciate. If you are looking for a decent laptop that can handle the demands of your average knowledge worker type job as well as leisure internet surfing, this would be a great option at a pretty good price."
5.0,Great sharp screen,"I absolutely love this one! The screen was most important to me, and it's simply the sharpest I could find in this price-range (it's IPS)."
1.0,Was decent until the screen went black 9 months in,"Save yourself the unnecessary stress and invest in a different laptop. The laptop was decent at first and was accomplishing what I needed it for. I bought the laptop for college, and it was a lot of money for a college student to invest in. Now, 9 months later, I am really regretting this purchase. I am in the thick of midterms and huge projects, and the screen decides to go black out of nowhere(this computer has not been dropped and has been kept inside of a case when not being used). Luckily, there is still 3 months left of the warranty on this laptop. However, I have to send it in to the service center. There is not any backup laptop provided in the meantime. This is my only laptop, so I rely on it to finish my schoolwork, projects and research. So, if you are like me and need a reliable laptop, look elsewhere."
5.0,Excellent Value,"Excellent Value. For the money this is one of the best deals out there. Great speed, lightweight, good battery life, and screen is crisp and bright. Glad I didn't drop three times the money for something that I wouldn't notice a ton of difference in."
1.0,Cheap keyboard,The M key popped off during initial setup.  Amazon is 2-day shipping me a replacement.  Will update again when the new one lands.
1.0,The Charging Doesn't WORK!,"I love it at first, but today my laptop wasn't not charging any more."
5.0,AMAZING!!!,"I love this so much, I bought it for school and it is definitely worth it, I don't know why it has a rating for touch screen on here for the review because it is not touch screen, however the finger print scanner is awesome and one of the reasons I bought this laptop. I just don't like that the keys do not have lights under them like my old macbook did for when I am in the dark."
4.0,Good but not amazing.,"I have just had this laptop for a few months so far. It is working well; good processing speed for downloading, internet, etc. It's lightweight. I have had the touch pad freeze up a few times already so that is a little worrying."
5.0,Great for work and personal use,"Purchased the Asus Vivobook for my significant other. Very lightweight and good for when you’re on the go a lot. My favorite things about this product are definitely the battery life and charger. The battery life boasts eight hours, and the charger itself has a curved port so there’s no way to ruin/kink the cable. The only downside to this product is that the speakers totally suck. You can barely hear anything on Youtube unless the volume is maximized and even then it’s still bad. Get headphones!"
5.0,The best budget laptop in the market,"This laptop is great overall. It's runs fast because of the latest intel core i5. I run premiere pro and it has never lagged or slowed down. Color looks accurate with the display but sometimes the screen looks like its dimmed. The only problem I have with this laptop is the audio. It's not that loud! I have to use headphones everytime there is some noise in the background. I wish they could've had better audio, and this would be a perfect editing machine. But the price is too good. With the specs and power this thing got, it's really a bargain. You can literally do the same things a $1,500 laptop can do with this laptop. It's a great deal."
5.0,Laptop,Me gusta mucho es rápida y me a servido para todo
4.0,CD/DVD player not included!,I needed an inexpensive laptop that would be mainly on battery power at a youth camp.  This laptop performed well and the battery life is excellent.  My bad; I didn't notice that a CD/DVD player was not included in this very thin laptop.  I bought a remote player for $25; now it's a complete product.
4.0,Pretty good computer.  Starts very fast but the sound and keyboard functionality isn't great.,Decent computer for the price.  Picture quality is good.  It runs quiet and cool.
5.0,Great laptop,Just received the laptop today and I have it in my vehicle. I'm always out on the road and bearly home so it's nice to set my phone as a hotspot and start studying. This is a upgrade from my laptop made in 2011.
5.0,Kick @#$ system,"This thing never runs out of power. Its light weight and supper easy and fast to use. The price is also a plus, just didn't want to spend 1,000.00 for an apple system. We have kids, college fees as well as RV living. Will order again. My only issue is: working on it at night. if the key board lite up would be awesome, but I have a chrome book for that."
4.0,Tech support was very responsive.  Responded within ‘24 hours.,"I loved this computer for the first three weeks that I owned it.  Then without any warning it just stopped working. The power light comes on, but the computer won’t start up.  I contacted ASUS tech support and they gave me instructions to do a hard reset, but that didn’t help at all.  I’m waiting until after the holidays to send it back.  They advised me to back up all of my data...too bad I can’t turn it on to back it up."
4.0,I kind of feel bad about the fact that it does not have a ...,"I kind of feel bad about the fact that it does not have a graphics card or a backlit keyboard, but for this price, this thing is a treat!"
4.0,As advertised.,First time owning a computer with a solid state drive. It books ridiculously fast!
5.0,Dependable little laptop,"This laptop was incredibly easy to set-up; it identifies my fingerprint smoothly every time I open it up. It has a decent battery life, nothing amazing but certainly within expectations. I am usually very cautious buying electronics online, even if from Amazon; however, this little Asus gets the job done every time I need it and it came securely packaged. Granted, I don't use it for any heavy projects (use a desktop for that) but it is a quick and efficient piece of machinery."
4.0,"Great Computer, Abysmal Speakers",I like everything about this laptop especially the fact that it is solid state.  The speakers are the weakest that I have ever seen and I am not a person that needs them that often.  But boy is it annoying when you are trying to hear anything over a video.  I don't know why they would make such a weak component on an otherwise stellar product.
4.0,Surprisingly sturdy machine even before upgrading hardware,"Running my smaller projects (primarily besides YouTube/managing social media accounts) in Visual Studio and SSMS + other development environments just fine. Light weight and easy to take around to meetups. Hoping to upgrade RAM, storage space though it is just fine for now."
5.0,Great Product for the Price!,"Bought this during the Prime day sale. under $600 shipped! For the price couldn't ask for a better lappy (well you could...) but really fast little to no bloatware, only took me maybe 10 mins to get it set up. Love the fingerprint feature, no touch screen (oh well) and no num pad, (can live w/out) But for the price the hardware you get is fantastic!!! Update: the sound quality does leave a bit to be desired, but that was rectified by a bluetooth speaker, still giving it 5 starts"
3.0,No recommended,"I like the speed, the processor the hybrid storage units (128SSD and 1Tera), but the web cam sucks, really poor resolution and the keyboard  doesn't have the numerical part and the caps lock or num lock don't have any light or guide to help you."
4.0,It's a great little laptop,"It's a great little laptop, but I miss dvd player  and keypad...It runs great and I've had not problems with it."
2.0,I loved this laptop until I didn't,"I am so bummed out! I loved this laptop. It's fast and light and has a great picture for watching videos. But I had to give up after twice having trouble with the display. The first one lasted 1 month from purchase. I went to turn it on one day and the display wouldn't come on no matter what I did. I returned it and Amazon replaced it asap. Super easy transition. The replacement lasted about a month and half before the display on it pooped out with no hope of fixing it. So, no more Asus Vivobooks for me. And I really loved it so its a sad day :("
5.0,Great product,"Great reliable laptop for college students. Good for light gaming, homework on this laptop runs smooth. Light weight for ease to carry around. Not a bulky laptop."
3.0,Good looking with ssd but hardware issues,Normally i can live with few hardware issues but this is  a itch I have to scratch.
5.0,Asus puts out a great product,"Bought for a portable for my husband on the job. He LOVES it. Easy set up, reliable performance, looks nice and reasonably priced. Everything you look for in a laptop."
5.0,Great Laptop for the price,"My husband needed a travel computer that he could use to work remotely and watch youtube, read emails, etc. He wanted something inexpensive, but with a decent screen and large-ish display and good battery life. Compareable HP and Dell models were very slow and had poor displays. This ASUS has been fantastic for our purposes."
4.0,Good machine but screen suddenly developed a crack,"This is a nice machine. With the 128GB SSD it is pretty good at starting up. Quite fast. Good keyboard. I bought it for the screen. Got it in April last year and it has been fine. Suddenly started developing a small crack in the upper right hand screen which over the past two days continues to develop and now is in across the top quarter.  This is some discoloration around the crack but it seems to pass. Called up ASUS and it will cost $365 to repair and add the shipping to them, close to $400. A new machine is $619 from Amazon! Not good service."
5.0,Champion for this price,"This laptop is excellent. The speed is fast, boot time is very less... battery life of 7-8 hours... very thin and light.... only questionable about the built of the laptop... the plastic top feels as if it will crack if put under little pressure... i dont like the plastic feel to the screen section of laptop.. but it is great value for money."
4.0,"Good for the price, just know what kind of games you are looking to run","Great laptop for the price. SSD makes the boot-up process lightning quick. Battery doesn't last too long when using it for gaming, but I'm usually plugged in anyway. Plastic casing around the screen sounds a little flimsy when opening the laptop. But it's super thin and light weight, and most importantly it runs most of the games I throw at it (I wouldn't even try to use it for Arma 3, obviously)"
4.0,Do not add a Logitech M510 wireless mouse,"Laptop was working just fine until we added a Logitech M510 wireless mouse. Then after logging in on the computer the screen would go black. Tried all the usual stuff, different usb port for the dongle, latest updates to Windows 10 (no drivers on the Logitech website for this mouse. Laptop always worked fine after unplugging the dongle and restarting the laptop. Guess we will have to find another mouse."
1.0,I feel like this was a mistake to purchase,"Out of the Four total days that I owned this laptop, one or two of those days were spent trying to reconfigure the laptop so that I could see the screen. The screen would only work with an external hookup, aka the projector in my living room. the LCD display failed after two and a half days I barely used it. It was used to access my syllabus quiz and the math program my college uses. That was it no fancy stuff or bugs are bots. It was very frustrating that this three-day old laptop decided to stop working because of a software issue but a hardware issue because Asus makes garbage laptops, do not buy an Asus"
1.0,Don't buy this brand!!!!!!,"Bought this computer for my son 4 months ago.  Last month screen failed.  All we see is black screen.  Had to pay $15 to send it back.  Was told the screen's problems were ""self induced"".  Whaaat?  I was skeptical about buying this brand.  Don't buy a computer online.  Don't buy this brand.  They don't stand behind their product.  $600 down the drain."
4.0,Great performance with the 128gb SSD BUT,"I've had it for just a couple of days but it works great so far! I mainly use it for audio editing with adobe auditions and it's waaaay faster than my older pc ever was (asus k55n). I installed all software stuff on the SSD and everything else (documents, music, downloads...) is on the hard drive."
5.0,Good.,Battery life is tricky.  For you to get a good battery life the screen brightness at 75% will give you 8hrs of battery life. While at 100% will give 4hrs.  Laptop is very light weight for the size 15 inches. PC drive is great 128gb SSD with 1000gb. The three USB ports are good with Hdmi. The structure of the keyboard not good. Will give more update
5.0,Great laptop at awesome price,"Just what i needed.  This thing starts up FAST.  I""m no computer expert but it's fast, it doesn't have a bunch of apps preinstalled that take up space, great display, and the battery seems to last a long time.  Also - has a cool fingerprint scanner that works good and is easy to set up."
1.0,Battery Issues and Terrible electronics return policy.,Battery is not holding a charge. The laptop will only work properly when plugged in. Amazon return policy on electronics was only 30 days.  I can return diapers up to 90 days. And most stores have 90 day returns. I spent almost an hour on the phone with Amazon then ASUS only to have to send the laptop to be repaired for a defective battery and not have access or compensation for up to 10 plus business days. Then I will have to reinstall all my data when I get the laptop back. I have only used this laptop 6 times over 60 days. This is the absolute opposite reason of why I use Amazon. Totally disappointed.
5.0,I love this laptop,"I love this laptop. Have had it since early May and it is everything I wanted. The laptop keys are a bit low and it took some getting used to, but other than that everything is awesome about this laptop."
5.0,"Light, Fast, Great screen",Great laptop. Perfect for online classes. Very happy with this purchase. I would recommend for college students or for people who need to travel.
1.0,Be careful and read all about this computer before  you buy,Has small C drive but 1 TB D drive makes it very confusing.
5.0,Extremely fast,I had problems with two laptops being very slow and Amazon was nice enough to let me return them and the last guy I talked to was very knowledgeable and this one is six times faster on the net the the fastest of the other two. Glad I spent the extra $125 and got both kinds of drives installed as well.
1.0,Dead on one month,"I bought this product on december and in less than a month it just stopped working. Since I live abroad, Asus won't cover any repairment so I have to pay extra to get it to work again. The repair center said that the issue was both the LCD display AND motherboard. I don't know if they sold me a defective product on purpose or by negligence but I'm very, very dissaponted."
5.0,The best for the price: good screen and very good performance.,"I bought this for my mother and she's very happy with it, especially with the Full HD display and slim bezels which are a world apart from the old laptop that she had. I installed some programs on it and it felt pretty snappy, especially taking into account the price."
5.0,So far so good...,"I popped an extra 32 memory in.  Although Windows 10 is not my ideal OS, I clean it up the best I can to leave the essentials.  Computer so far is fast and suits my needs for browsing and school work.  The larger screen is nice as well."
5.0,Great machine,This laptop is about 18mo old now and I still love it. Especially love the optional SSD for the IS! Good value for the price.
5.0,Great laptop for the price,"Works well, Has a fairly solid feel to it.  Good sound quality.  Good batter life so far."
5.0,Good all Around Computer,"Great computer for work/school. It boots up quick, has plenty of storage space and is a decent price."
3.0,To be perfectly honest,"I like the laptop for it's hardware, and it's working properly."
1.0,"two hours working, one month in repair","Terrible quality, it worked 2 hours and burned the screen, now I have a month buying replacement parts and the manufacturer just gave me a parcial refund (they know wich kind of computer its that), I would have preferred a computer that worked, amazon be careful what they offer on your page, some of us are going to think twice to buy again, this computer has been a nightmare"
3.0,C (Average) for some B - (Almost Great) for others,"Overall Grade: C (For Me, read Consideration)"
4.0,"Light weight laptop, no RJ45","Purchased for my department at work, only drawback is it does not have an RJ45 port, strictly on Wi-Fi, so if you need connected network port, this is not for you.  But overall it is light weight, no problem so far."
5.0,Best laptop for the price,"Bought this laptop for college work. I decided to get the ssd version of the laptop, was not disappointed. Turning the laptop on takes about 30 seconds. This is a very good laptop for the 600$ range"
2.0,Blank Screen after Second Use,"The computer is fast and was beautiful when it worked as intended. Literally the second time I started using it, the screen when completely blank. I plugged in a 2nd monitor and I could use my laptop fine at that point, but the main laptop screen remained black no matter what I did."
5.0,Like the look and feel,"I really liked the color and model of this laptop. Nice and sleek. Hardware and everything is pretty good - screen, mousepad, usb and other ports, sound."
4.0,No backlit keyboard but good value,No backlit keyboard is a big letdown for me. Unit can get pretty hot while plugged in. Mine did d not come with Spectra installed . A good value is the 1tb + ssd combo.. not bad for the price. Good enough for basic browsing and some multi tasking with multiple apps. Good value but you have to spend more for premium stuff.
5.0,nice working labtot,"it seems to be a well built laptop, i use it for surfing the web. & storing pictures and videos"
5.0,Good deal!,Initial impression:
1.0,Waste of Money - Buyer beware!,Worked for 2 months.  Called Amazon and they replaced it with the same computer.  The new computer failed again with the same error.  I am sure Amazon will exchange it again but it is not worth the time and hassle.
2.0,Minor Mechanical Problems Abound,"I had issues with the touchpad sticking or not responding to click correctly from the start. These issues periodically go away then come back randomly. The speakers are also not great and the max volume on watching Netflix or other videos is rather quite. At this point, the fan has become incredibly loud grinding almost all of the time. This compounds the problems with the quiet audio and is just broadly unpleasant whenever using the computer. It's still a mainly functional computer, but using it is just not the greatest."
3.0,Makes weird noises,"Its an ok laptop , it makes crackling annoying noises sometimes, im worried that it will become worse with time so I will be returning it, also the speakers are really bed , keyboard is good enough."
5.0,"Fast, lightweight and large screen","I wanted a computer that was fast enough to handle multiple open browser windows, Google Earth & maps, home office processing and photo organizing. This computer does ALL of that! I am very happy. The screen is huge, but the computer is lightweight. For the price I paid, I feel like I got a great deal."
