5.0,Perfect pack,"Update after a few weeks of use: I still love this pack! I have my transit pass tucked into one of the cup holders so I can easily reach it when I get on the train/bus. ALSO, I've added a picture of some rain that sat on the fabric, and hasn't absorbed after a 30 min train ride."
1.0,When it first arrived I was pleasantly surprised to find the zippers were all very big and the quality felt great. This pack is,"I was initially a little concerned about purchasing this pack because of the negative reviews regarding the zipper quality. When it first arrived I was pleasantly surprised to find the zippers were all very big and the quality felt great. This pack is big and has more than enough room for my laptop, tablet, books, and all my other small stuff."
1.0,Both of our teens love this backpack,"Both of our teens love this backpack. Unfortunately, the zipper broke on one. We wrote to Swiss Army because it was only 1 year old and under warranty. Unfortunately they did not respond, so we just bought another. It's roomy and works very well for a student in high school or college. We do have another that has not broken , so hoping it will not happen again."
5.0,Five Stars,
4.0,"Very nice pack, but beware there are very subtle difference between some models.","This is a virtually identical review I wrote for the model SA1923, which I now use."
1.0,8 months of light use and tearing on the zipper.,"So I purchased this backpack around April 2017 as I needed one to transport my laptop whenever I needed to do some work outside my place of work (like a coffee shop). In short, I rarely used the backpack the whole 8 months I owned it. The backpack load are normally a slim 15"" Lenovo laptop and accessories, portable drive and bottled water; nothing too heavy. So today I noticed there was half an inch tear on the zipper stitches (with fraying) in the 2nd front compartment of the backpack. Sure it's a small tear (that could get bigger if not replaced/repaired) but this is supposed to be a well built backpack, but after 8 months of light use,  it is falling apart. It isn't a cheap backpack either and one expects many years of use from it. This would be the last time I will be purchasing this brand of backpack. Hard earned money down the drain."
1.0,SURPRISED BY POOR QUALITY,I received this product 9/2/2017. I am a full time biology student and wanted a backpack that could withstand the heavy textbooks if I decided to carry them--Which I often do not for the sake of my back!
1.0,Don't waste your time or money,Two bags ripped. The warranty process is a joke and their partners are worthless. Not worth spending anymore time or money with this company. Putting these in the trash where they belong. Recommend searching online for sturdy bags with companies who actually stand behind their products.
1.0,Zipper popped after 5 months!,"So I'm hoping I can get help with the manufacturers on this one. I LOVE Swiss Gear and have purchased several of their backpacks in the past. They have always lasted several years and seemed durable. My 11 year old used my old one and liked it so much he asked for one for school this year? Knowing how tough kids can be on bookbags I decided this bag would be perfect for him, because it's generally a very durable product. Well here we are just 5 months into the year and both front zippers came off the bag while he was at school and he could not carry his books home. Not sure what happened with this particular bag because I've had 3 of them in the past. Backpacked all over Europe with all 3 and NEVER ran into this. Is this bag under warranty still? Do we have any recourse or am I just out of a bag and out of my money too? :("
2.0,Used for 7 months and the zipper broke!,"I purchased the SwissGear Travel Gear Scan Smart Backpack for our son's first semester in college. He started using the backpack in the Fall Semester 2016 and my son just came home this evening from Spring Break 2017 and he informed us that he needed a new backpack because the zipper broke on the compartment that holds his laptop. Not only did the zipper break but the zipper actually separated from the backpack material (See picture). It's a gorgeous backpack and full of great pockets and compartments but definitely not durable.  I have had a Swiss Gear Computer Back for over 10 years that I still use for work. My backpack has been all over the world, Japan, Kuwait, Australia, New Zealand and my 10 year old SwissGear backpack works as good as new. I am SO disappointed that my son got less than 7 months use out his."
2.0,NO PADDING ALONG EDGES,"First of all, this bag doesn't protect your laptop from anything except if someone hits you from behind. Once you take the backpack off, you had DAMNED WELL BETTER be sure you're putting it down super slowly. The bottom and side edges of the laptop pocket have no padding whatsoever."
5.0,Very Happy With This Bag!,"I am very pleased with the construction and design of this bag.  The materials used are solid and sturdy.  I am impressed with the stictching throughout the bag.  The overal design was well thoughtout.  The interior has plenty of space for multiple larger books while still being able to use both side mesh pockets (water bottle in one side, reuseable coffee mug in the other).  The bag gives excellent protection for a laptop and tablet.  The front orgiazational pocket has enough space to fit multiple things in without over crowding making everything easy to get to.  Carry handle is heavy duty and comfortable."
4.0,"SA1900 - Good quality, great amount of storage space, but can I get a few more pockets?",I have multiple laptops I can assure fit in this backpack:
1.0,This is not easy to check,"I've used this bag for a month to carry my lunchbox, my water bottles, and a few books around work. I have to go through a bag check every time I enter a building. This is not easy to check. The large pocket does not want to open all the way without considerable effort, and the middle ""tablet"" pouch is an utter waste of space in this regard. I keep my 2 calculators in this pocket and nothing else can reasonably fit in it."
1.0,I used to love these bags because they look and feel nice,"I would gove 0 stars if I could because Swiss Gear has gone down hill over the past couple of years. I used to love these bags because they look and feel nice, while still being extremely functional. The past 3 bags that I have gotten from SwissGear have all fallen apart with in months of me buying them. All different problems like broken zipper, broken strap and torn material on all parts of the bags. I purchased this bag because I was thinking maybe it had been a fluke thing..... guess again. A broken zipper after 1 1/2 months. I try to reach out to see what kind of warranty the bag had and after sending them a receipt from Amazon and a picture of the problem with my bag, this wasn't good enough for them to move forward with the warranty process. They had a long list and over 5 pictures to take of the bag, just for me to have to pay to send back a bag that was faulty. So I'm already in the hole with this bag and now you want me to spend all of this time just to start the warranty process??? Worst company ever. My time is valuable too. Time is money so pay up because your bags have become just another cheap bag and you need to refine your warranty process. I will just bad mouth you to everyone that I see because doing your list to get you to honor your warranty just isn't worth it to me. This whole experience has made me want to make you hurt where it hurts the most. Your wallet. I will never buy one of these crappy bags ever again, and I will bad mouth you till the cows come home. SwissGear is garbage. Please stay away from these guys."
5.0,Some things other reviews missed,"Great backpack. I'll cover things most reviews don't. The main zipper is very heavy duty and should last a decade, at least. The 1900 has a spot for a full sized ipad (not for rubber case though) instead of extra compartment. What's great about the pouch is it is inset so your ipad will be protected. What is interesting about the laptop pouch is 1 zipper will open the backpack like a book, but you will still need to open the side zipper to get the laptop... since the side zipper is accessible from the outside, you can bypass the full zipper and just pull the laptop out from the side. The full zipper is good if you cram your backpack and things are tight."
5.0,A Perfect Backpack...," Whether you are a traveller or hobbyist hiker or just an office person who needs to carry his work laptop, you will need a comfortable backpack ,I have been using this for long enough and serves all the above purposes, let’s take a look at this SWISSGEAR Travel Backpack"
1.0,Don't Buy!,"For the price I expected a much more durable product. I only used this on 2 flights. Probably carried it for  about 3 hours total including  on and off the planes.  I was shocked to see it  is already ripping  at the seams. And not just a small rip, about 2 inches. This rip is in the smaller front pocket which only had pens, some post its and mints in it. So it wasn't overstuffed by any means.  I can only imagine how the other seams will be. Sadly I am 4 days late on being able to return it. So this fairly pricey backpack was NOT worth the price."
5.0,I am in the Swiss Gear family now!!!!!,I work for the federal government and I am in the field quite a bit. That means everything I use in my office has to be transported to my Midstream River location and I noticed that most of the other surveyors all seem to have Swiss Gear backpacks. I've had numerous conversations with them and all they do is praise the quality durability and how comfortable their backpack wears when packed full. I don't think I have ever used comfortable and backpack in the same sentence. My research resulted with the reality of how expensive these swissgear backpacks can be. But hang on a minute! I have been a loyal Amazon disciple and have been a part of the Amazon Prime family for going on two years now and lo and behold a daily deal came out and this was the backpack for sale for only fifty bucks. As I said before I had researched the Swiss Gear backpack so I know all of the models and this one is a true classic. I just received it today and I am all smiles. Small and big pockets for all of my equipment and three different spots for my laptop and my tablet and my analysis machine. I even have room for my lunch and a tasty beverage. All kidding aside this thing is very very well made and I especially commend Swiss Gear for all of the padding and attention to comfort as I am like my peers and can pack a backpack full. The coolest thing about this backpack is they put a little spot on one of the shoulder straps for my sunglasses! Holy cow it's this thing dispenses beer I have got it made. In all seriousness you just can't go wrong with one of these backpacks as I have been envious for about a year-and-a-half watching my coworkers enjoy this sheer quality and comfort.....
5.0,Just What I was Looking For,"I was stuck deciding between this bag and a high Sierra one for high school. Unfortunately, my old highsierra broken after a good 4 years of use. While I was thinking about getting another one like it, I caught a glimpse of this bag. My mouth dropped as I inspected the amazing deal. ""60% off?!?!?!?!"" I thought to myself. ""There has got to be some sort of catch to this."" And now after a almost a week of continuous use, I am happy to report that there is none. This bag is literally the epitome of perfection. It's good for all conditions of weather(rain, snow, etc.), it's extremely durable, and it has more than enough space for anything. Being a highschooler, I unfortunately have to carry 3 inch thick (yes, I measured the thickness of my books) textbooks around with me all day. This also includes, my lunch, gym clothes, 4 binders, and 13 inch laptop. My old backpack was reduced to trash due to this. However, this backpack treats that challenge like it's nothing for it has more than enough space. The bag has tons (and I mean TONS) OF extra pockets hidden around for little things such as cellphones, house/car keys, ear buds, and more. What I like even more is the fact that the main compartment zips down to 3/4 of the backpack. This comes in handy if someone is going to the airport and needs to show the security all the electronics through a metal detector or something. I haven't really used this feature yet, but it surely will come in hand later on. And as an added bonus, Swiss gear gives the owner a great warranty for the bag. This comes with every purchase of the bag made (you don't have to purchase it additionally). I am extremely satisfied with this backpack and would buy from Swissgear again."
5.0,Best travel backpack I've ever had!,"This backpack fits everything I need for a quick weekend trip. Clothes, laptop, etc. -- it's an amazing carry-on bag! The straps are comfortable, even while dashing to make a connecting flight."
1.0,Don't buy for heavy duty use.,"The design is bad because it tapers up so you have more room on the bottom than on the top. There are way too many pockets, compartments and therefore, zippers. I cut out the divider inside because I couldn't figure out a use for it. It just got in the way of putting things in there. The material is incredibly insulating and there is zero airflow even though it advertises as having an airflow feature. Do not use in summer."
4.0,Great,"Got this backpack as a replacement for another Swiss Gear backpack that I had, not because there was anything wrong with it, just that it didn't fit my new larger laptop.  I had my other Swiss Gear backpack for 8 years and other than normal wear and tear, which really wasn't much, is still in (now at about 10 years) really good condition.  That backpack literally traveled the world with me.  This one at barely a year and a half has already started to show signs of long term wear and tear.  Swiss Gear is honoring their warranty, but I have to pay for shipping, and they are just going to ""repair"" it and can take up to a month.  Personally, I think they should be paying for shipping and/or I should get a whole new bag.  I have other Swiss Gear things that have held up really well, so I don't know if this was the one that was made on a Friday at 4:59 pm and didn't quite get QA'd properly.  Love their products, just still not too sure about this one yet."
5.0,"Great product for traveling, school and college!","Best backpack you could ever offer, has a lot of storage for a lot of stuff like books, folders, pencils, sharpeners, phone, tablet, laptop, camera, keys, chargers, clothing, shoes, make-up, two water bottles, snacks, etc. there are so many pockets and zippers. I was surprised by how much stuff this backpack can pack! could fit more than what a normal backpack could, it is just like a small suitcase. Fits my 15.6 inch laptop, it could fit like up to 3 laptops, 2 iPad's, 1 phone, my shoulders or back don't feel sore at all. I love that you could have your phone inside, connect your earphones to your phone, take out your earphones through a little whole and listen to music on your phone while carrying in the backpack (phone pocket). Great price and Great arriving! I recieved it in 2 days!"
5.0,Love this backpack,"This is my second Swiss Gear backpack, even though my first one is still in decent shape I wanted more pockets and organization - which this one totally gives you.  My husband has this backpack in black and has had it for over 5 years now.  Now we match.  Just the ability to have so much stuff put into so many different pockets is perfect as everything has a place and fits without having to go digging for what you are looking for."
3.0,Red and Black Backpack,"I thought it was bigger, than what it really is. In the picture the space looks bigger, but its mostly padding for the laptop. I thought this would be an awesome college backpack. Don't get me wrong, I still holds a couple of binders or one big textbook, but I can't carry my whole days worth of classes in this back pack. In one of the pictures the back pack opens flat, I assumed that was where the laptop went, but the laptop actually goes in behind that space (as this space is the part for your books) the zipper for the laptop compartment only opens half way up, so if your laptop is bulky and some what hard to put into straps, its going to be difficult because it doesn't open all the way up. But there is alot of padding. there is a space for your tablet, but nothing to keep the tablet in place. The largest front pocket opens to have a sleeve for either your cell phone, or ipod, with a hole for the earbuds to go through, it also has a net pocket that zips. This compartment has file folder like things. If I could remove those, I would have space to put more binders or books, but they're attached. I love all the small pockets. There are a ton of pockets on the outside, all zippered pockets, except the net ones that are used for drinks. There is a small one on the front, and a medium size one on the front, the lower one is where the pencil pockets and little agenda books go. the smaller one is where i keep my usb, but I can fit my whole hand into the pocket, so its probably not that small considering. the back pack also has two deep side pockets maybe around 8 inches in depth and two net pockets that are used for soda cans or water bottles. Another nice thing about the backpack is it comes with an attached clip, to hang my keys off of. the straps are padded and have three looped areas either for sunglasses or just to hang stuff off of. They are adjustable. The backpack also has a really sturdy handle on the top, made of thick rubber, it doesn't leave your hand hurting when picking up your backpack like that. Its a really nice backpack, just wish it had more room. It feels like its built to last."
4.0,Very good backpack from SwissGear,"I went from a blue SwissGear backpack to this backpack.  My 6 year old blue backpack was starting to fall apart where you grab it at the top and would hurt my hands.  But I beat that backpack up, used it vigorously, loaded it daily beyond capacity, and it took a massive beating and kept on going."
1.0,Worst Engineering of a Backpack Ever,"Usually Swiss Gear products are fairly well made. Unfortunately, the person who was responsible for the engineering of this bag should be fired. I've included two photographs. The first is the bag leaning against a cabinet. This is the only way the bag will sit up. The second photo is what happens to the bag when it is placed on the floor or any other flat surface (table, desk, etc.). It immediately falls flat on its front. REALLY? I've rearranged the contents in the bag attempting to distribute the weight so it will stand up on its own. No luck. It is designed for a laptop to be placed in the back of the bag. Still falls face first. I purchased this bag for my son for school. He refuses to use it. I use it for work, but it is basically the joke of the office now. Please don't waste your money."
2.0,Good Quality - Questionable Function,"Note:  My review doesn't reflect the SwissGear quality, only the function."
5.0,Well Worth The Price,"This backpack is so good at retaining its shape while swallowing up our middle schoolers' many books, binders, folders, stationary and jacket.  It replaces his SwissGear backpack from 2yrs ago of similar size and model.  Because that one held up so well is why we looked to this model to be the perfect replacement."
3.0,"Although sturdy, NOT  adequately padded or protected.",It appears to be very sturdy.  But I'm frustrated that padding seems insufficient to protect my laptop.  I was very sad when my prior HP brand backpack (no longer made) finally wore out.  I spent a long time searching online before deciding on this model - was willing to pay considerably more in hope of getting something similar to my prior backpack.  But here are poor design in my opinion:
5.0,Still my perfect backpack after a year!,"After using the same backpack for 10 years it was finally time to get a new one. I bought several but was always disappointed until now. I love this backpack so much! I'm 5""11 (180cm) tall and I find this bag to be a perfect fit. The design is perfect for both college and international travel which is what I used my last one for. I love the dual water bottle holders. I love how the pockets are designed to retrieve things easily. I LOVE the cell phone pocket (I never lose my phone in the deep abyss anymore!) I love the carabiner clip. I'm surprised how often I use it to keep track of my keys. Only one thing to keep in mind is that when it rains, the inside will get wet if you don't cover it with an umbrella or something similar. Edit: I forgot to mention the ""TSA"" laptop feature. The security check didn't let me keep it inside but the side zipper and dedicated pocket for the laptop is the easiest I've ever had to retrieve the laptop for the security bin quickly. I dare say I like it even better than the Jansport I retired after a decade!"
5.0,especially when one carries a laptop and all the other crap TSA has a problem with,"I seldom write a personal, in in-depth review, but - here goes..."
5.0,The perfect back pack for me ... well ... almost :),4.9 stars ... ALMOST perfect :)
4.0,A solid all-around backpack.,"This is a very well made, highly functional overnight/ day pack that's almost perfect.  It's spacious and fairly well organized.  Just a few minor oversights stop it from receiving a perfect rating.  Probably the biggest among these is with a fold down platform to give it a solid base & the very substantial handle, it's designed to stand up & could potentially be placed on the floor.  Why not give it a waterproof bottom or at least feet?  The placement of the audio interface also raises some minor concerns.  It's directly on top of the bag & not complete sealable.  This could lead to water entering the bag in heavy rain situations.  Not good........  Other than that, my other nitpicks are probably more of a personal nature.  A couple of more zippered pockets internally couldn't hurt as well as adding a chest & waist strap."
2.0,Don't believe the photo - No luggage strap,"The luggage strap as depicted in the 6th photo does not exist. I do not think it was a missing part, since there is nothing to clip it to. I think they just discontinued this feature, which is a must for a travel bag. I am returning. Also, the bag is huge, too big to qualify as a personal item on a plane. The rule is rarely enforced, but on a crowded flight, an attendant may say you have 2 carryons. As to the bag, it is very well made, but way too compartmentalized. 7 zippered pockets. If you are looking for something at the airport, you better have a good memory as to where you stashed it. Inside the zippered pockets, there are mort pockets. Ideal for someone with severe OCD, but not for me."
4.0,Great bag for larger laptops.,"Bought this to replace a 7 year old Swissgear Ibis for 17"" laptops. It carried my Alienware M17x for years. To Iraq and Afghanistan and all over Europe and the States. The zipper finally broke and so it was time to replace it. After reading a bunch of reviews, I finally decided on this one. It's a decent enough alternative to the Ibis. I like all the pockets and the side laptop zipper and compartment. The side holders have no problem with my water bottles and coffee mug although I wish the strap would secure down just a bit more. The side zippered pockets are super nice and deep. Hold plenty of items well. The shoulder straps are top quality and a swissgear design that keeps me coming back."
1.0,I purchased this backpack as a present for my son ...,"I purchased this backpack as a present for my son. When he received it, the top of the bag was ripped, and it had somebody's homework inside. Completely unacceptable. When you buy this product, you must be careful, because you might be purchasing a used item sold to you as if it were new."
4.0,Nice laptop backback for work,"This backpack has a ton of features! I did considerable research before purchasing it for my husband, who totes around a large laptop for work. I wanted something with all the bells and whistles, but still in a reasonable price range. The backpack came as expected and the material actually looks very nice and professional. While this wouldn't be out of place for a school backpack, it certainly seems more substantial. The water bottle holder was key for us - he doesn't go anywhere without one - so I am glad to see that there is a secure pouch for to tote around a Nalgene or similar water bottle. We really like the TSA lay-flat feature, but will have to report back on how it works at the airport. With two kids in tow, it's nice to have one fewer thing to unpack at security! I also like the headphones hole, but I don't really know how much use that will get unless he buys a pair of headphones that can control his phone."
1.0,As annoying as it was to walk around with a broken ...,"I typically do not write reviews for products I buy, but I must chime in on the quality of this backpack. I've had this backpack since September 2016. After approximately a year of use, I noticed the zipper seam coming apart on the laptop compartment. Eventually, the zipper came off the track and I could not zip up the laptop compartment. I attempted to fix it and it worked for about 2 months. The track ended up coming apart and I could no longer zip up the laptop compartment.  So I figure I can get away with not using the laptop compartment and use another compartment for my laptop and just walk around with the laptop compartment unzipped. The stitching on the shoulder strap is also coming apart.  As annoying as it was to walk around with a broken laptop, I would live with it. I started to contact SwissGear warranty support since it was still under warranty. After reviewing some of the other one-star reviews on here, I see that would be a waste of time. I even thought about buying another and chalk this up to a lemon I got. However, I see this is a common issue.  Long story short, I will not buy another SwissGear backpack. Someone else who gave a one-star review suggested hitting them where it hurts, their wallet.  I will never patronize this company again.  Do yourself a favor and avoid a​ headache and get another brand."
5.0,"This is a nice, heavy duty pack","This is a nice, heavy duty pack. I am not a huge fan of how some of the zippered compartments are organized because i don't see this as a laptop pack, nevertheless, that doesn't prevent me from putting in whatever i want, so i suppose it can be viewed as a plus too. Took to mountains and on a 3 week tour of Asia. Great for organizing your essential stuff (or whatever). Again, i am most happy with just how heavy duty this thing is. on the negative side, i think the very back compartment could use some work so you can organize things better (e.g. IDs, wallets, keys, pens, flashlights, etc). it is not bad by any means, but i prefer to keep different things segregated from on another--there are some zipper, velcro, and mesh pouches in there, so i don't want to be too critical; just my preference. there are also other compartments on the sides which is good. in sum, whether you use as carry on luggage, something to keep your laptop in, or to use in harsh environments, i definitely like it quite a bit. one thing i would say though--if you buy this for your laptop, books and papers, there are lighter ones available that are very similar but lighter and more tailored for that sort of thing. i bought one from EXOS that i am very satisfied with (black with yellow accents). hope this helps"
5.0,Versatile and exceptional for the price,"This was supposed to be a gift for my wife at Christmas. However, my in laws bought her another SwissGear version of this backpack. So what did I do? I turned this bad boy into a ""Go"" bag!!"
3.0,"Not the best SwissGear pack, but manageable","For a preface, I will mention that I purchased this backpack for use at university and not as a travel pack."
5.0,Great backpack but too big to meet the small requirement for our single piece of allowed luggage.,"This backpack is very well made and everything worked just as described. The zippers were well sewn and easy to open. The backpack was very comfortable when on, with the heaviest expected item - a laptop - snug against the back. The pocket for the laptop was very well padded, with both sides of the inside padded to accommodate both a laptop and a tablet. A particularly nice feature allowed easy access to the laptop area from the outside by a zipper on the side. The remainder of the backpack was smaller than I expected but would easily hold enough items for a flight (I take spare clothing and lots of food for the two of us on long flights.), it would not hold enough items for an extended vacation and would need to be accompanied by another carryon or checked luggage."
3.0,Very good bag but has a lack of balance.,"It's my first time in almost 10 years with a new bag. My old one was a Targus computer backpack I got from Best Buy replaced for free when broken twice in the past. I was looking for a new bag with features that would make it more comfy to carry my computer and essentials like plugs / battery packs / umbrella on rainy days / pens / a pad / my lunch box / and one to two water bottles. I drink protein for breakfast and in the summer would like to carry water as well. My old bag only held one bottle and when I stuck my lunchbox in the bag, it made it jet out backward. It felt heavy and was not liked by fellow subway riders."
5.0,Love this bag!,I'm a bag lover and I am super picky. Like *super* picky.
5.0,Love it!,"This is a great backpack for carrying a laptop!  I work both at home and at the office, so take my laptop, its accessories, and about a dozen client files back and forth every day.  I had been using a briefcase type bag with a shoulder strap, but it didn't have enough room for all my files and was uncomfortable to carry for more than a short time.  I recently had a trip planned and wanted a really good backpack to bring on the plane -- something that could carry my laptop and my carry-on items comfortably."
3.0,Nice bag with serious design flaws,"This was likely the most expensive backpack purchase I've ever made and was very excited when I received it. However after 6-9 months of daily usage for college; some of the flaws became so overbearing that I began searching for a replacement. I want to add as a disclaimer that physical environment was a considerable contributing factor for my review, so that may be interpreted as a non-objective bias by some readers out there.. with that said; I'd like to first explore the pros/strengths of this bag.."
5.0,Fantastic for 17.3 inch MSI Gaming Laptop.,"I bought this for better protection for my 17.3 inch MSI Ge72 Apache gaming laptop. Surprisingly enough there are no real laptop bags/cases for anything above a 15.6 inch laptop.... until I find this. I at first thought the section to where the laptop goes in was going to be annoying, troublesome, pain in the neck, but after a week of removing and inserting my laptop into the specified laptop section of this back pack, I never had any problems. The zipper for it only zips half the pack, so you have to insert the laptop (any laptop) at angle from the bottom and push the top inward, this turned out to be not a pain as I originally thought. With my specific gaming laptop (being thicker and heavier than regular laptops), it fits nicely, but going to say perfect as the zipper does at the very top corner of the laptop rub against it, but not in a damaging fashion nor is it tight after completing the zip as if the laptop is squeezed and going to break through the zipper, this is not the case. Just a slight rub. When it comes to my very expensive laptop, I am very picky about damage even a slight cosmetic scratch would most likely result in a horrific rage that would hurtand destroy anything and anyone nearby. So when I say I am very pleased with this backpack for my large 17.3 inch laptop, I mean it. I also have huge headphones with surround sound and a 17.3 inch laptop cooling pad with 5 fans plus the necessary accessories like mouse, power cord, wipes for cleaning the screen and keyboard, etc all in this bag and I feel ashamed as not even half of the space is used up with all my equipment. On another note... this bag is huge so if you are 5 foot 7 or shorter,  you would most likely look funny wearing this backpack, but you would be able to put a lot of stuff in it. I could easily put all my shampoo, body wash, toothbrush, and a set of clothes in the bag along with my electronics and still have room, but since I'm over protective, I fear the body wash or shampoo bottle might open up and leak inside (as I am constantly changing altitudes and the pressure sometimes pops the cap open) the bag causing water damage to my laptop, so I still have a separate bag for that as well as I don't use my laptop in the bathroom anyway. I have no comment on airport use as I have not flown since I received the backpack, but wouldn't care if they make me empty it anyway, just happy I finally found a usable protective backpack for my beastly laptop. Another note, there is a velcro strap in the laptop section, I do not use it,  I feel its more for smaller laptops that might freely move, but my gaming laptop is just big enough it is not a tight fit, but won't move either. And as for the zipper thing, again it does zip tight around the corner but DOES NOT cause pressure on the laptop or zipper once completely zipped. My only suggestion for the next model, have the laptop section zipper actually zip at least 2/3 of the bag, not just one side, should do one side and the top at least. As of now it only zips from 4 inches from bottom to about 2 inches on top horizontally, should go the entire top, not a complaint, just a suggestion."
5.0,"Excellent quality, strength and look","This is my third Wenger/Swiss gear Bag, two were exactly the same and this only slightly different. Two were stolen and because I am so happy with these I got another one. They are strong, really strong. Especially the single carry handle. But also the two shoulder straps. I sometimes put quite a heavy load in them. They also look good and durable. The zips are great quality. It sits comfortable on the back due to a specially designed padded area with netting material that breathes."
5.0,The almost perfect backpack,"I'm really enjoying this backpack. It has plenty of pockets for my camera gear and accessories, laptop, notebook, iPad, tabletop tripod, cords, etc, etc. The front top zippered pocket is perfect for those small items you need to access quickly. The phone pouch just inside the main pocket would be better suited for a small power bank "
5.0,This backpack is great. I currently own a 15,"This backpack is great. I currently own a 15.6 ASUS laptop which fits perfectly into the laptop compartment, which also conveniently has a velcro strap to put over my laptop for stability. It also easily holds all my books and notebooks or school, and the straps are very durable and much more comfortable than expected, considering the substantial weight I carry every day. I have had this bag since August of 2016 and as of yet, none of the stitching is coming loose, and all the straps and zippers are still holding as well as the day i received the backpack. I would highly recommend this bag to anyone looking for a quality laptop bag, but especially to students, as mine has stood up to the stresses of carrying a laptop and heavy books and an assortment of other school supplies for a few months now, and continues to do so with no loss of integrity."
3.0,"Great looking, sturdy bag with lots of pockets-lasted 15 mos.","My son wanted a decent backpack, not from the regular chain stores, and a I wanted a backpack that I wouldn't have to replace mid year.  He's in middle school. We settled on this one and have both been happy.  He carries a ton of books in it, and it's held up for half the year so far.  He loves all the pockets and it's very sturdy.  Definitely worth the price since I typically have ended up buying two throughout his school year. I'm hopeful it takes him through a couple years or more."
3.0,"The quality isn't on par with the price, and there isn't much space","The quality is okay, but it isn't good enough to justify the price. The weave of the fabric is allot less dense than my previous pack, and the organization inside could be better."
5.0,Great bag - roomy and sturdy,"I use this as my work laptop bag, which means I'm using it daily, and I love it.  It's huge and has enough room for me to carry my laptop, an umbrella that I generally leave in there all the time, my work shoes (I wear tennis shoes in and out of work), all my laptop cords, my headset, my mouse, etc, etc and still has room for plenty of other miscellany.  It's sturdy and nice looking and I'd recommend it.  The only problem I have is that I'm not sure how useful the 'TSA Scansmart' feature is - I have flown with the new bag and the whole point is that the design of the bag should theoretically allow you to simply flip it open and not have to remove it so that it can be scanned separately from the contents in the other half of your bag.  I travel pretty frequently and have never seen a TSA agent that didn't immediately demand each and every person in line pull out their laptop and place it into a bin, regardless of the 'technology' of their bag.  They weren't going to let me leave it in there for a second!  But that's not the fault of the bag...still highly recommend!"
3.0,Loved it; One Sewing Defect,"My company bought me a monster 17.3"" Dell Laptop.  Of course, it didn't fit my long time work bag.  So I bought the SwissGear 1900 bag for my new computer.  Guess what?  IT FITS!!  The TSA SmartScan pocket is way cool.  Can't wait to use it on an upcoming trip.  My Kindle fits in the tablet pocket.  This bag has so many pockets and containers, so many places to put things.  LOTS OF SPACE!"
2.0,Holes and tear in the upholstery after 2 years of moderate use,"The quality of SwissGear has really fallen. I bought this bag to replace a similar SwissGear bag, which I owned and used almost every day for a decade. This included travelling abroad on multiple occasions and rugged used. After less than 2 years of almost daily moderate use, with no traveling abroad, the bag has developed holes just above the zipper lining. Additionally the upholstery on the front pocket is starting to tear away from the lining after no apparent external damage. Based on my experience thus far, I highly doubt that I will get the same use out of this bag as the previous one."
3.0,... had to return this product as the strap broke pretty quickly-within a month,"I had to return this product as the strap broke pretty quickly-within a month.  I gave it three stars because the company did stand behind the product and I was able to return it with no problem at all.  Also, the delivery was quick and on time. There were several things I did like about the bag like the organizational compartments and the thickness of the bag itself.  It was also comfortable to wear. I think I may have just gotten a defect and think the product would have been sturdy and reliable over time other than this strap issue.  I ended up buying another LLBean backpack as that is what I have purchased over the years and never had any problems with."
2.0,Zipper Quality is bad,HEED THE WARNINGS...DO NOT BUY
2.0,"Do your research, this is nothing like previous versions.","I'm not impressed.  I bought this to replace my second ""SwissGear® Ibex Backpack With 17"" Laptop Pocket"" that was no longer available.  Having had two of the previous SwissGear versions and been very happy with them I assumed that this one would be an improvement but it's the opposite as it has far less useful available storage."
1.0,Zipper Broken after a half dozen uses,"With a name like SwissGear, one would hope that durability would be a key feature.  I've used this bag maybe 6 or 7 times and the zipper on the primary compartment failed, while it was on my back, and the bag flipped open and the contents were all over the floor.  Luckily the laptop was in a different compartment or we'd be having a different conversation.  Very displeased at this moment.  Caveat emptor."
4.0,"Good bag, but not really for 19"" laptop","I purchased this item because when I was looking for a 19 inch laptop carry solution, it's what the Amazon search came up with.  I carry a an HP pavilion entertainment pc (laptop) (laptop pouch) and an Alienware 18x (main compartment), and 2 cool master x-slims (one in the access compartment between the laptop pouch, the other in the main compartment), 2 OPOLAR, the power bricks for both, and various USB cables.  It will fit all that - barely - and that's the reason it's 4 and not 5 stars.  Both laptops apply too much pressure on the material of the bag, if you know anything about material - this will cause it to wear out prematurely, and it's already noticeable on where the corners of my Alienware rest on the main compartment.  I was deliberately looking for an oversized bag to avoid that specific issue, but no dice on this one."
5.0,Worked at TSA checkpoints in O'Hare and Orlando,"I held off on writing my review on this tech backpack until I had the opportunity to travel with it.  I needed a backpack to protect my Alienware 13 laptop while flying and I did not want to have to take my laptop out of my bag during TSA check out of fear it would be damaged.  TSA allowed me to keep my laptop inside the ""smart check"" compartment at both O'Hare international airport in Chicago and Orland Airport in Florida.  I had no issues with TSA telling me to take my laptop out."
4.0,"Very durable, water resistant, with a flaw",This is nearly a perfect backpack; but has 2 significant downsides regarding its design.
4.0,Document pocket difficult to access.,"Loved this backpack. Took it on a two week trip where i was flying and changing planes. It holds a ton! My computer was safe as well as my binoculars and camera equipment, a change of clothes and a heavy sweatshirt needed for going in and out of cooler climates.The only draw back was the document pocket is difficult to retrieve items when it is so full. The pocket ends up being more on the bottom of the bag than the side. if I unzipped it entirely, items easily fell out because of the angle. My partner couldn't retrieve items for me while it was on my back, meaning I had to take it off and lay it on its back to open the pocket. Still, I love this bag, and will try not to pack it as tight as I did the first time to see if it is ant better."
5.0,Must Buy for Business Travel,"Absolutely love this back pack! I'm very please with all of the space. The provided pockets for different items is amazing. I don't use the TSA feature simply because they usually make you pull your laptop out anyway so that's and xtra pocket for me. The larger front pocket is the ""never ending pocket""! I packed for a 3 day business trip... clothes, shoes, belt, hygiene items, note book, laptop, other electrionic items, and snacks comfortable in this backpack. With room to spare. It's been on 3 trips with me so far and I have no complaints."
3.0,Works OK. Definitely not waterproof,The backpack does and is what it indicates in the description and I am generally happy with it. I have a few issues though:
1.0,"Worst Swiss Gear bag design I have seen.  More room in my simple 15"" Swiss Gear Bag.",The way this bag is laid out makes it hold a laptop and nothing else.  It does the fancy fold out for security but I find it to be way more of a PITA than just pulling the laptop out by itself.  All the space is wasted inside because of the 69 organizers like the Taurus bag.  They both suck compared to my bugout bag that I have had for 10 years.  That bag has seen to many deployments and needs to be replaced.  I finally just bought another one cause  these bags sucked.
4.0,Not A Bad Backpack,"Just used this backpack for the first time on a week long vacation trip, taking it as a carry on and using it on the trip on some day hikes and city excursions."
3.0,Completely Average,"This is a perfect example of what qualifies as a three star product in my opinion. For the price, it isn't a bad value, and there are some features of the uber-compartmentalized design that work quite well. With that said, I was using this to replace an older version of this bag (circa roughly 2011) and the materials on this bag feel noticeably cheaper than my old one feels even after 6 years of wear. Also, unlike my older version the bag also doesn't have the sturdy flat bottom which allows it to sit upright (I'm sure the flimsier material also contributes to this)."
5.0,Wish I'd had this 15 years ago...recommend without hesitation,"I bought this backpack with some hesitation. Not because of Swiss Gear or the overall good reviews, but because I was so used to using a leather shoulder bag as my daily computer, etc., bag.  I just came back from a short business cross country trip and this was all I needed for a change of clothes, tablets, computer, toiletries, documents, etc.  The bag still had room, kept everything well protected, organized, easy to access, fit under the seat in front of me.  The TSA agent said I could have left the laptop inside the bag, just opened it up as advertised.  It's not as 'classy' as my coach leather case, but much more versatile, practical, and useful.  Without a doubt, I wish I'd had this 15 years ago when I started my international expatriate traveling career.  It would have saved me a lot of hassle and travel annoyance over the years.  Zippers seem very sturdy, well thought out side pockets for water bottles, center top pocket for boarding passes, passport, etc.  Would recommend without hesitation, great buy for the business traveler.  I look forward to using as a daily business bag as well."
1.0,The bag is in excellent gently-used condition except for the zipper issue,Update: I had the bag repaired through their warranty service and it promptly broke again after 1 week of use. I have asked for a new replacement bag considering this is the 2nd issue but they only offer the repair service again.  I will never buy the brand again.  And I am telling everyone I know how awful the product and the service is...
5.0,"So far, so good","Got this for my 10-year-old starting 5th grade.  Wanted a durable, attractive backpack that would last.  School just started, so I can't comment yet on whether it lasts, but so far so good.  I will update this at the end of the school year.  I am hoping for a backpack that lasts at least two years, hopefully even more than that.  I like the number of pockets and dividers.  So far, the zippers seem good (I know some people have complained about the zippers in other reviews).  The two side pockets are perfect for a compact umbrella and a backpack rain cover. There are dividers in one of the big compartments that make storing folders a breeze.  We haven't used the laptop area yet, but it looks perfect.  So far, I can recommend this product, but it's the kind of product you need to use for at least a year before the review is meaningful."
5.0,"Frigging great backpack, matches my luggage too!",This is probably my favorite backpack I've ever had.
5.0,Such a great product. My previous backpack was a Carhartt that ...,"Such a great product. My previous backpack was a Carhartt that cost about $40 more and had nowhere near the amount of space, features, or quality of construction as this one. The pack is extremely well organized, with appropriate pockets for all the different things you might need to carry. It will hold a LARGE laptop very securely with an easy velcro strap. Dedicated tablet slot in the middle, well-padded pocket. In the roomy main pocket it has notebook organizers and a zippered pouch for accessories and stuff, and I particularly love the dedicated cell-phone sleeve inside near the top, with a water-resistant-ish dedicated headphone cord port. SwissGear really thought through every detail on the design and usability of this one."
4.0,Great for travel or everyday use,"I purchased this backpack for a trip (bus tour) through Europe.  I was nervous purchasing because I wasn't sure if it would be big enough to use as a general backpack and for a carry-on item, and small enough to not be cumbersome with it on my back all day as we walked around Paris and London all day.  I can say it works great for both applications.  There are only two negatives for me;  1)  There are too many dividers within the front storage areas.  There are two in the main front storage area and one in the small front pocket where you would carry keys and a wallet.  2)  The design of the back makes it front heavy.  The main front area is the largest and deepest, with the back two being narrower meant for storing such items as a laptop or notebook.  This design makes the back front heavy and when items are in the front pocket and a light or no load in the back, it flops over on it's front.  Every time.  Even with these issues, I would still recommend."
2.0,Not what I was expecting. Beware there are no free returns for this product.,"I'm looking for a more medium-sized backback, since I want to be able to use it when traveling as a personal item and put it under the seat, but I can tell from experience this size of backpack won't let me rest my feet very comfortably (I understand that may be personal preference). However, the quality of the zipper in the lower compartment you can definitely tell is less sturdy and it seems like it will break soon. One more thing it didn't feel right for me is the distribution of weight when wearing this backpack. It just felt... weird when I transferred the things from my current backpack to try this it on this one, so maybe keep that in mind if you plan to use most of the compartments."
5.0,GET IT! You won't regret it.,"Been using this since the beginning of school, and let me just say, It's really worth the price. Now let me tell you why."
5.0,Great for travel and everyday use,"I bought this to travel with.  I found that I didn't use the middle unzipping feature.  TSA wanted me to completely remove my laptop and iPad, completely negating that feature of the backpack.  But, that's not the only reason I bought this.  I was very happy with the backpack overall.  The main compartment of the bag was surprisingly roomy.  There are dividers in the main section and are useful when traveling with many tech items.  I was able to fit a fairly large gopro case with accessories, a battery bank, a cable organizer, power bricks, snacks, and paperwork all in the main section of the backpack.  The laptop section only zips for 1/2 of the bag, which was strange at first, but I don't mind it now.  The handle has a solid piece of metal inside it, instead of just being attached with nylon like other backpacks.  I found this to make the backpack very sturdy to handle when moving it around in the airport and on planes."
5.0,Hurricane Irma Strong,"I lived in the Caribbean when hurricane Irma came. I lost everything to be honest. I had this bag, my shoes, some clothes that were covered in fiber glass due to trying to rummage in what was left of my apartment and some photos and random objects. It held everything. When we were able to get water, this bag was able to hold to much. I had to carry some clothes as well as my cousins clothes to the ocean to wash. I didnt  have much rooms for our towels. No problem. It had something on the bottom ( two straps) that were practically made for extra cloth carrying. Honestly after evacuation i travelled and bounced between different countries and ended up and weird scenarios and this bag never failed me. It always had some extra compartment somewhere. This bag will never let you down. Im thankful for it to be honest. Too bad it couldnt withstand my mothers cluthes but honestly. I love this bag and it will hold a favorable place in my heart."
5.0,THERE ARE SO MANY POCKETSES,I LOVE this backpack!
4.0,"Nice looking and great quality, but too small for gaming laptops","I had some concerns about loading my laptop from a side zipper instead of the top, but there are so few really nice backpacks since the Targus XL went cheap. I hoped this one would do the job and it's everything I hoped it would be other than being teeny tiny. The backpack looks like a middleschooler's bag and my laptops definitely don't fit (Toshiba Qosmio and Asus ROG). Seriously, I thought I was being punked. The description says 19"" and the reviews by others seemed to say it would work, but lol, no. Maybe if you had a standard laptop instead of gaming then... maybe? But this thing wouldn't fit my laptops naked nevermind with the sleeves I like to put them in for additional protection."
2.0,Grey Heather is not,"If you are looking for something other than the boring black backpacks and saw this heather grey one, it is not.  My monitors are color-calibrated, and the product page shows a modern/trendy heather gray color.  It, however, is much darker and with a distinct blue hue.  I would say it is halfway to a denim color!"
3.0,Awesome backpack except for laptop compartment,"I love this backpack in every way, except for the laptop storage area. I've broken 2 Macbook pro 15"" screens now using this as the lower corners of the laptop compartment does not have much in the way of padding. My older 2015 model could take this, only getting a few dents in frame (but not cracking), but the 2017 cracked after 5 months from setting it down a little hard on carpet/tile transition strip at the airport and I just corner-cracked my 3 week old 2018 just from putting it on the floor of my car (not even sure what it hit). If more padding, or even hard bottom corners, could be put in, this would be the best backpack ever (all the pockets, compartments and zippers make this a great travel/work backpack)."
5.0,Perfect backpack for college student,"I'm a college student who lives out of her backpack, and I absolutely love this bag. There is a place for everything, which helps me to stay organized.  The laptop compartment is very well padded and secure, and has an additional pocket that is perfect for my Wacom drawing tablet, or smaller devices like my Kindle Fire.  Because of all the padding, and the overall robustness of the design, it's not the lightest backpack.  But the straps are very well made and distribute the weight evenly.  Also, the mesh-covered padding on the back makes it comfortable to wear, even in warm weather.  And while I don't know if it's 100% waterproof, so far it has stood up really well to the rain...at least the mild, sporadic kind of rain we get in southern California.  In short, I highly recommend this backpack, and would buy it again in a heartbeat."
5.0,Best backpack ever! No regrets!,"This is the best backpack ever. I was sold on how many compartments it had as I'm obsessed with organization. Swiss Gear has been known to be high quality and had surpassed my expectation with this bag. Super roomy, lots of functional compartments, thick strong fabric, good looking design, uniform stitching, sleek metal zippers, comfy shoulder straps, and thick padding. I use it as a work bag to help balance the load on my shoulders of the stuff I have to carry. My messenger bag is great and all, but it shifted my weight to one side so my neck and shoulders started hurting. So because of that I opted for a backpack and really happy to have made this purchase. Can't wait to use it to pack stuff for camping either! Btw, I'm 5"" tall petite female and this bag is practically 1/3 my size, lol. Doesn't look ridiculous on me at all and I like how comfortable it feels when I'm carrying it around. Highly recommended! Oh, forgot to mention the side pockets can carry my 40oz fat canteen around on either side with no problem and it stays put!"
2.0,well made but akward shape,"This is well made but the shape is not so conducive to packing. It would help if the design was more square and the compartments were shaped more like items that you would actually pack. The side pouches, for example, are long, deep, and narrow, unlike anything I use (it would be good for rulers). It would be helpful for the dividers inside the main compartment to be adjustable, as is the strap for the laptop section."
4.0,"So MANY pockets! Almost TOO MANY pockets! Plus, unlike my dog, I can't teach the bag to sit up straight!","Honestly, this is an amazing backpack. It has so much storage space it's ridiculous and so many pockets it's actually really easy to lose stuff within its many compartments. It's practically a real life bag of holding (There's an obscure Dungeons and Dragons reference for you!). The ONLY thing that keeps it from being the perfect bag is that it's TOO front heavy. This bag will not sit straight up no matter what I do! It is constantly falling forward on its front face all the time and will not sit up straight! Even with my laptop in the rearmost pocket the bag just falls over on its front ALL THE TIME! Other than that it's a great bag. If you want a bag that will pretty much hold anything you need and don't mind laying it on its face all the time then this may be the bag for you!"
5.0,great bag,"well Swiss gear has been everywhere I see there bags everywhere 90% of the bags I see in airports are Swiss gear  and  this trip this bag went around the world 6 airports scanned at airports 18 times hotels 16 times and malls 3 times never had a problem with it and the x-ray equipment for size or ability to split the bag with the zippers tsa still made my computer and tablet come out, but the bag was built well to make that happen fast and stay together. the bag made it to my jobsite every day sat on the ground next to me and was moved constantly I didn't have any problems with zippers stitching or handles  to be honest I wish the side pouches would have been a bit larger for my Camelback Chute 1L Water Bottle to fit better but it still fit and worked for me I enjoyed the bag and it held up well. I would say I would get it again but I really hope I don't need to for many years of use  my last bag lasted 8 years"
4.0,"Comfortable, lots of room, wish it had better organization pockets","The backpack is comfortable carry (huge necessity!) and I'm sure will be fine at the airport (haven't used that feature yet, but my husband has same backpack and has used it many times.)  There is plenty of room, which as a teacher, is needed as I bring home a lot of papers to grade and other work. The downside is the front pocket.  I wish it were taller; meaning the pocket went all or most of the way up the front of the backpack, so that it could have more organization abilities and a few little mesh zipper pockets.  When I try to use the pen/pencil holder in that pocket, they fall out all the time.  Another backpack I've used doesn't have that issue at all, so it doesn't have to be that way. I'd rather have one bigger pocket with the organization of those smaller items than the lower and upper front pockets.  I have to remember what I put where.  With one pocket, it would be easier and actually more organized."
4.0,I purchased a slim lunch bag that fits perfect into the front large storage area and still allows ...,"So far I am loving it, I have been through 3 packs in the past year trying to find one that can be an all-in-on for me, hold my work devices, gym clothes, and lunch bag so I don't have to carry multiple bags.."
4.0,Great laptop bag for travel,"Very high quality backpack.  It easily fits my 15.6"" laptop with plenty of room to spare.  In fact, I use it to travel with my 15.6 personal and smaller work laptop in the same bag.  The TSA laptop zipper is great but TSA usually makes me take my laptop out of the bag anyway.  There are plenty of pockets for stuff.  Only con is that doesn't have a luggage strap so you can't attach it to the handle of a larger roller suitcase.  Most TSA laptop bags have those so not sure why this bag doesn't.  There are a few after market luggage straps that you can buy to solve that problem but it's still a hassle and should be added to the design of the bag.  Aside from the strap, it's an excellent bag, very high quality, and has tons of space!"
4.0,Nice backpack for laptop and more,"The laptop space will hold a 17.3"" laptop (Dell XPS 17 16.3w x 11.3d x 1.5h). It is tight but it does fit. There is a padded foam bar that is removable, held in by velcro to help keep the laptop in place. The inside wall of this compartment is padded around the outside walls about 1"" and then a mesh window for the ScanSmart. The zipper starts at the middle of the backpack and opens downward The ScanSmart compartment has a holder for tablet (iPad Air with cover fit in this with very little wiggle room)."
5.0,Works great for a university student or an avid flyer!,"So far I've used this bag both for flying and university and I've had no issues! The laptop sleeve works just fine (and YES it will fit a 17"" laptop) and is able to protect a laptop very well either on the bus or an overhead bin. The sleeve also makes it super easy to pull out the laptop when passing through security. The large main pocket can hold A LOT, I've never had issues packing my carry on or my books for class. The side pockets are excellent for hiding things you need like power banks or acetaminophen. The large bottle pockets are big enough for over 1 L sized bottles and the straps make sure they don't fall out as you walk. After 3 months heavy use there are no tears, breaks, or issues with the bag."
5.0,I LOVE IT!!!!,"I will admit that when I first saw the backpack, I was disappointed.  It looked so much smaller than it looks in the pictures.  I was wondering how in the world will all my stuff fit in here.  I was about to package it all back up and send it back.  Something told me to at least try to get my things in it.  Boy was I surprised when I noticed how the backpack handled EVERYTHING I put into it.  I have a LOT of things and it got it all stored just fine.  the backpack did not even feel heavy at all.  There's still room for even more stuff.  This is a GREAT backpack.  I couldn't ask for anything more.  Additionally, the price was great too.  Thank you so much for making this affordable for consumers like me.  I love this backpack."
5.0,All purpose school and travel backpack!,I bought this backpack in July 2017 after a very sad departure of my previous. :(
3.0,Almost great but one huge flaw IMO,First the flaws that have me looking fo a replacement:
5.0,Amazing laptop backpack with a ton of space and pockets.,"This is by far one of the best laptop backpacks I've ever used. I like to keep a ton of gadgets, nick-nacks, and gear with me at all times and this pack really helps keep me organized. I had a different SwissGear backpack for about six months before this one and it worked well but I initially wanted something with a better back area. I tried an Osprey Manta 28 AG with airscape but decided to return it and go back to a pack that was meant to hold a laptop. The pack was large considering how much space it offered and the hipbelt strap was a bit much for a daily commuter pack (loved everything else about it though and will definitely pick one up when I need a hiking pack). It seems like this backpack will hold much more of my stuff but is deeper instead of taller (which is a plus imho)."
4.0,"Great bag, but is sounds like you're wearing bells...","Overall, it's a great bag! Lots of padding, pockets and everything. It has LOADS of room inside, it's divided inside to keep documents and files in order and it can keep a tablet and a laptop safe at the same time. Oh, and it's TSA approved."
4.0,"Good price, good materials. Comfortable to wear.","The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I don't like the method to secure your laptop in place inside the compartment. The placement of the Velcro on the soft strap that goes over the laptop to  hold it in place is not well placed, at least not for me. It makes you think it will not hold the laptop firm enough. I know I'm been a little picky with this but I have seen better solutions (kudos to Samsonite) in other brands. All in all, the product is made of good quality materials and is comfortable to wear. Price paid was good ($47). I was hoping to have a sunglasses dedicated pocket but I can't complain since I chose not to buy a $100 Ogio. Good product for someone looking not so expensive alternative. Please view the pictures to understand what I explain about the laptop strap thing."
5.0,Zero regrets.,"I wanted to give this bag some time to prove itself, and it continues to amaze me. I looked at a LOT of bags, even ones by much more expensive brands, and I have zero regrets with this one. For the price, this is a stellar piece of gear."
3.0,OK but not as practical as expected,Intrigued by the SmartScan feature I chose this model when my old Swiss backpack retired. The key feature indeed works well and avoids the hassle around laptops at airports. So far so good.
3.0,"More Compartments Than Practically Needed, Maybe?","I'll keep this bag. My stars are not enthusiastic only because the number of compartments (I think a bit too numerous) has occasioned a lot of padding, which has resulted, for my taste, more bulk (and some weight) than desired. For my first trip abroad after this arrived, I opted to remain with my laptop bag which has basically two compartments and two outside pockets. It was able to hold everything I had previously packed in this backpack, more comfortably without bulk. Admittedly, the backpack would have managed the weight on my back far more comfortably than the computer bag on one shoulder or in one hand. I expect that I shall use this bag with lots of satisfaction in the future, though."
5.0,Love this bag!,"There are a gazillion backpack options on the market, it can be hard to choose one that works just right. The goal for this backpack was to find an ideal backpack to be used as a diaper/toddler supply bag. This fit the bill perfectly."
2.0,Design Flaw. Does not stay upright,"I had a very similar backpack by the same manufacturer which I bought over 6 years ago. It still works perfectly well but very dirty. This new one has a major deign flaw. when you put it down on the ground, it will fall flat on its face. This can be quite annoying under some circumstances. Imagine you are waiting at the airport security check line and every time you put down your backpack, if rolls flat on its face and makes a loud noise when the metal parts hanging on its front hit the ground. Look at the photo. I compared the old and new and figured out what the design flaw was."
2.0,The reason for the low rating on this one is really a matter of the trend I see that I do not like. These bags have lost a lot o,"I have been carrying a Swiss Gear back pack everyday of my life for about 15 years now. You know no matter how hard you are on them they just hold up. It is my mini office and never worry about it giving out. The reason for the low rating on this one is really a matter of the trend I see that I do not like. These bags have lost a lot of their usable space because of this ""lay flat"" design. What you lose is a nice big pocket to cram over night clothing or jacket. I hate how this thing flops wide open. I want my usable space back! I don't want to worry about all of my stuff ending up on the floor because the zippers worked their way apart. I am struggling to find one with lots of pockets anymore and may have to finally consider another product. I am returning this one... PLUS this thing is HUGE!!!"
5.0,Excellent nylon exterior,"Seems the world of backpacks is rife with options, many of which are top notch. There are outdoor backpacks, student backpacks, utility backpacks, drink a bunch of fluids from your backpacks...for me, I needed a practical alternative to packing a briefcase every time I needed to go to a coffee shop or take a business trip that didn't involve meeting with a client or appearing in court. So this here SwissGear beauty fit the bill perfectly.  Excellent nylon exterior, clean compartmentalization for laptop(s), tablets, power cords and accessories, my Hydroflask, pens, files, and all that stuff.  Holds a ton of material securely.  Shoulder straps keep the load snug and comfortable.  Additional loops and clips keep my pockets clear of keys, etc.  I use this baby daily and get annoyed when I have to take stuff out for a briefcase.  10 out of 10 would recommend and buy again."
5.0,What I was looking for.,"I bought it for an upcoming trip.  I was looking for a computer backpack to carry my laptop plus accessories, and some clothes.  My laptop fit in the back compartment design for it.  The middle compartment is big enough for accessories and some clothes.  The front pocket is perfect for miscellaneous items and the side pockets for snacks/small water bottles.  I am carrying another backpack for clothes only and should be able to carry both inside the plane because it meet TSA requirements and airliners rules."
5.0,Great value for the price,"I have a passion for SwissGear backpacks which doesn't make me the most objective reviewer in the world. I am a computer consultant and travel a lot. This backpack is the most similar to the one I have recently retired, after 5 years of service and over a million airplane miles. It is a very comfortable and large backpack which can hold all of my electronics (laptop, tablet, chargers, USB cables, laptop power cord, cordless mouse), some additional clothes, and a bunch of small stuff like pens, thumb drives, business cards etc. The quality of SwissGear backpacks is excellent, they are very sturdy and rugged. This backpack is not an exception, I like it already. Also, being so similar to the one I had before, I am not wasting time searching and browsing through it needlessly. This one will probably go on for 5 years as well and is excellent value for the money. I love this backpack!"
5.0,"A great backpack, priced reasonably",This is my third Swiss Gear backpack in about ten years. I've had many backpacks in my day. The Swiss gear packs are the best I have seen. I don't actually carry a laptop in the pack. I do carry books and printed matter in it. It is made well with beefy zippers and thick cloth. These packs stand up to hard use. I like how it stands up vertical when you set it down. It has a lot of compartments for items. It is reasonably priced. It is better than packs I've had at more than twice the price. I recommend this pack
4.0,A good backpack but it may not be the best choice to carry laptops in.,"A good sturdy backpack with a lot of slots/pockets but the ""laptop"" holding part is not something I like."
5.0,"Compactable, easy storage","Love love love this backpack! Highly recommend this backpack for traveling, school, anything in between! Lots of storage space without being too bulky. The first day i used this backpack I was out in the rain and my contents stayed dry as a bone! Helps keep me organized at school with a variety of pockets to store notebooks, laptop, glasses, pencils, snacks!. A small feature i love is in the main compartment there are these ""tabs"" to separate books and notebooks so they don't get bent or torn. In the mid compartment there's a small packet for I assume an Ipad but i use it to keep my small textbooks neat and unbent. The laptop carrier in the back compartment has a built in netting to make sure your laptop doesnt get broken when youre running around. LOoove it. Must buy"
5.0,Awesome organizational backpack,"LOVE this backpack!!! So many pockets to cram my numerous textbooks, binders, and so on. I don't travel, but the TSA thing is nice because I am planning to do so at a later date. Really sleek and modern design, too. As with everything, be cautious stuffing too much into this, particularly since... this design has NO WAIST STRAP. That's important because waist straps enable you to balance weight more efficiently against your body and back than shoulder straps alone do. So, don't go crazy with filling this."
5.0,Perfect for world travel,I used this and a carryon suitcase to travel the world for four months.  I couldn’t have done it without this backpack.
4.0,"Jingle bells, Jingle bells","Do you hear that sound?  That's the sound of me walking with this backpack on.  It sounds like Santa's blessed sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.  Jingle, jingle jingle etc.  The zipper tabs are mostly metal, and there are many of them, and they all clank around like jingle bells. People can hear me coming from 100 yards away, which makes it hard to sneek into those business meetings:"
1.0,It's a crap. And it's not roomy at all!,"I had a Swiss Gear 15"" laptop backpack for about ten years and it was awesome. It was sturdy and it had a lot of room. When it started to wear out, I decided to buy a new one and I didn't even think about another brand. So I came to Amazon and saw this as the best seller. I also noticed that it fit a 19"" laptop, so I assumed it would be even bigger than my old one. I purchased this and soon realized it's not even close the the old product. It doesn't fit a 19"" laptop as the title claims. It's a lie (you can also see people say this in the q&a section). But that's not my main issue. The real problem is the main (front) compartment, which is very tight, and doesn't stretch too much to fit your stuff. It's significantly smaller than my old backpack (which was in fact a 15"" backpack). I was misled by a video review by a woman here who claimed it's very roomy and good for travel and  she claimed she could put her dresses and shoes and other personal stuff there. It's not like that. In fact even if you don't put your laptop there, you don't have much room to put your stuff. The other problem is that the laptop compartment is too stiff and it pushes the front compartment to the front which causes the backpack to fall down (toward the front). So you can't put it on the ground without the help of your legs holding it. Its not Stable. I am totally disappointed with this product (and now changed my mind about Swiss Gear). I wish I didn't buy this crap. I hope you can find this useful and think before buying it."
4.0,Does the job.,"I have had this pack now for 3 months. It is not as large as my previous pack, but it does the job I need it to. Only three issues with it so far."
4.0,Not TSA Friendly,"I was still required to pull out my Gaming Laptop and other electronic devices into seperate scanning bins. I guess this would be great for TSA Pre Check Passangers, but not for the average airline passanger."
2.0,"Good for someone, but be careful about knockoffs.","I had a hard time even giving this 2 stars and tried to come up with a good reason. The description promises many things but the pack, as a whole, simply doesn't live up to it. The shoulders are uncomfortable, it feels cheap and a bit like cardboard, just all around uncomfortable. It also seems to be lacking in features that were described. (which when I have time will come back and point out).  It and another pack I ordered really just seem to be knock-offs of the brand. Further, even though I thought I was ordering two different packs to try out, they are nearly identical. (SwissGear 2762 ScanSmart Laptop Backpack.) I would be careful on this one."
5.0,Oh yea! This bag works for a L.A. train commuter that takes lunch to work,"It’s really hard to find a good backpack for the daily commute. When you are taking computer, lunch, paperwork and need the complement of cables, chargers, battery cells, it’s tough."
5.0,"Excellent ...but the zippers do ""jangle"" a lot when moving",I picked this based on some review and did not review any details...
5.0,A great backpack,"This bag is not as large as some reviews implied. But, it has plenty of room for your mobile office. My 15"" MacBook fits with room to spare and can be inserted and removed easily via the partial opening that offers good protection against it inadvertently falling out when removing it. A larger laptop might not fit so easily. The spot for a tablet fits an iPad Mini perfectly. There is even enough room for an overnight trip, so long as you are not trying to pack a suite in it--extra shirt, underwear and toiletries will fit fine. The smartphone pouch fits my iPhone 7 plus perfectly and offers convenient access to headphone cords when using the Bose noise reduction headphones. Workmanship appears to be excellent and likely to provide a long life."
5.0,SwissGear Superiority,"A gift for my daughter for both college and overseas travel, it makes other backpacks seem like medieval torture devices.  It centers heavy books wonderfully, has a organizational structure that's not random, many little surprise handy things throughout...too many to mention.  Wonderful 'fold out' for airport security.  Great quality, solid, and stylish as well."
3.0,"They claim this backpack fits a 17"" laptop but it does not","I bought this specifically so that it would fit my girlfriend's 17"" laptop. It did not, so I figured I'd just use this to carry my 15"" laptop on a quick weekend trip. It did not even fit my 15"" laptop. It is a complete disaster. This bag was not good, TSA could not see things inside of it and my bag had to be searched several times which wound up with me standing there looking like an idiot, holding up the line, and eventually having to carry my laptop with me in my hands and keep it on my lap for the duration of the flight."
5.0,I love this backpack,"I love this backpack. It is awesome if you have a job where you have to travel a lot. The back laptop pouch holds up to a 17"" laptop and the middle pocket is great for my iPad and sometimes my second laptop. The other middle pocket is great for files not to mention it has dividers in it to keep you organized. This pocket is big enough to fit a binder or a couple books. The front is has two smaller pockets one on the top which is nice to keep your keys or a smaller wallet and the bottom is big enough to fit a small book or even a small purse. The side pockets are great for my umbrella and laptop chargers. and Finally there is a nice pocket inside to put your phone and feed your earbuds through. The straps and back are super padded and comfortable. The strap also has a nice spot to hand your glasses. If you can't tell by my review I really love this backpack and highly recommend it!!"
4.0,Nice sturdy backpack. Tight fit for an Alienware M17x R3,"The backpack itself feels sturdy and looks great. It has a plenty of pockets where you can store stuff. I have been looking for a backpack for my Alienware 17X R3 laptop, and after reading conflicting answers on the internet about whether it would fit my laptop, i decided to take the plunge and purchase it. I can confirm that it does fit the laptop but it is a very tight fit. The bag is narrower at the top which is the main issue. It took some maneuvering to get the laptop in and close the zip. I decided to keep the bag since i only plan to use it rarely, and i don't want to go through the hassle of returning it."
5.0,"Fits a large laptop, the TSA easy scan actually worked, comfortable feel, looks great","Great backpack for traveling. I debated getting a smaller backpack, but opted out for this one due to the product reviews and the fact that it has the TSA easy scan, where you simply open up the backpack without having to take the laptop out."
5.0,Can't imagine a better backpack for a graduate student!,"I had my previous backpack for 7 years and used it almost every day of those 7 years, in school, work, and travel, so I did a lot of research before choosing to replace it. I am so glad I found this one! I am a graduate student with quite a commute on public transportation, so my backpack has to: carry a very heavy load, hold up to bad winter weather, have many compartments to hold all the things I need to be out for the whole day, NOT HURT MY BACK, and function as an additional travel bag when I fly home. This backpack ticked all those boxes and exceeded my expectations."
3.0,Great design but cheap material,I bought this to replace my last Swiss Gear backpack that had lasted over 5 years.
4.0,My only issue is that the front small pocket bulges out a bit more than I'd like even when I have nothing in it,My go-to backpack for everything from everyday use to backpacking. My only issue is that the front small pocket bulges out a bit more than I'd like even when I have nothing in it. I'd give it a 4.5 star instead of a 4 if there were such an option.
5.0,I am a Swiss Gear converted customer for life!,"I don't know why it took me so long to buy one of these...!  I have used Targus as well as tactical (military grade) backpacks, but I have never experienced ZIPPERS like these before..  They are heavy duty and yet move very smoothly to open and close the pack.  They also have heavy duty pull handles on them, so they should last.  I also LOVE the streamlined outside.. it does not catch on things.  I LOVE the extra pockets on the outside; the tall ones on the sides can hold my Fujitsu scanner easily, and the pockets on the front hold all of my extra cables and gear.  I also LOVE how the internal compartments are INSULATED to protect laptops!!  There is a main compartment and it holds my Toshiba laptop (15"" x 10"" - diagonal = 18"") with no issues.  There is also a second insulated compartment that will hold another huge laptop, but I use it for my iPad Pro 12.9"".  The third large compartment is perfectly set up for paperwork, but will expand nicely to hold gym clothes or other gear.  I saved the BEST comment for last; the compartments unzip COMPLETELY OPEN... they lay flat!!  How SWEET this is..!!  This backpack will lay completely open when you unzip it all the way.  One more thing, the center of gravity on this pack is set low, so when carrying 2 laptops, I can carry them longer before my old back starts hurting.  I am a Swiss Gear converted customer for life!"
3.0,I decided to get smart with the second backpack and bought the Asurion protection,"My son loves this backpack and it is well made EXCEPT for the zippers.  The first backpack I got him lasted almost 6 months before the zipper shredded away from the backpack, leaving it gaping open at the top.  I decided to get smart with the second backpack and bought the Asurion protection.  Sure enough, 4 months later the zipper on this backpack separated from its backing on one side, leaving it stuck half open and half closed.  I filed a claim with the plan today - will see what becomes of it.  Even though my son loves this backpack, I will not buy another Swiss Gear, the zippers are faulty.  Neither backpack was overloaded, but the motion of pulling the zipper to open or close causes the zipper teeth to fail."
2.0,Good bag but ScanSmart not so smart,"Seems to be a well-made, smartly-designed bag, but understand that the ScanSmart system is not compatible with many security systems: the bag when unfolded in two either won’t fit in the bins or TSA will not allow the tablet side since there are items under it. I went through security and was confronted with this problem and had to take my laptop and tablet out. I spoke with 2 TSA agents who confirmed this."
5.0,this is a fantastic choice. Has held up on many camping trips ...,"I've used this backpack for the last 1+ year.  Very high quality mesh material.  Durable oversized zippers.  For a student with a laptop and notebook, this is a fantastic choice.  Has held up on many camping trips with me as well carrying maps, books, flashlights, etc.  Should have no problem holding up for years to come."
5.0,Great heavy duty backpack.,Great backpack for a variety of uses. This is not a lightweight or compact' backpack due to it being made of durable material. I had one pretty much identical to this besides a couple of small changes due to model changes. That backpack went everywhere for years until it was stolen. I decided to pull the trigger on this one and am super happy with it.
1.0,DO NOT BUY FROM EBAGS!,Ebags customer service is awful.
5.0,Fantastic tech bag - highly recommended!,"Perfect size, a ton of pockets, ideal padding, and has an overall solid and comfortable feel. I purchased this a week ago for a trip. I used this as my catch-all tech bag and loaded a 14"" laptop, 3 iPads, various charges, a power strip, and lots of little travel tech goodies. It doesn't feel overloaded and it handles everything nicely."
5.0,Best backpack!,I cannot say enough good things about this backpack!
1.0,"Too heavy/bulky, caused severe neck pain","This bag is heavy and bulky. After using it for a couple weeks, I realized the chronic and excruciating neck pain wasn’t due to the books I was carrying in it, but from the bag itself. I’m not sure if it’s the bag’s weight or form/style, but I started using an old bookbag from 10 years ago and within a few days, my neck pain resolved. The unfortunate thing is I spent $60 on this bag based on the many, many positive reviews and really could not have known it would cause such problems until after I used it and thereby negating my opportunity to return it. So my recommendation to others would be to practice first - a few laps around the neighborhood."
3.0,good bag but I need a smaller laptop,The Swiss Gear backpack is very well made and has lots of handy compartments.
