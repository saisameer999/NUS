5.0,Good little laptop,Got this for my kids for school. So far so good.  Very small and lightweight.  I plan to purchase another one so they each have their own.
1.0,Nice little computer but slow at logging in,Very nice computer I got it for one thing and that’s just to use iTunes to connect my phone or my iPad to it to physically wiped out data on my iPhone and iPad and just use it for software updates on my phone and tablet it seems the computer was pretty fast at set up but I uninstalled all the apps that came in it and then it popped up saying I need to restart for it to fix any disc errors it restarted the update and did the scan and then it went back to the welcome screen typed in my four digit pin and then it takes about two minutes for it to login I understand this is aVery low-end computer but I don’t expect it to take two minutes to login
5.0,Great  or  students,My  son  has  this  as  part  of  his  graduation  present  from  Elementary  school.  As  he  begins  Middle school  this  fall  he'll  be  prepared  with  his  own  laptop  to  do all  his  reports  with  plenty  of  memory  stored.

3.0,Slower then I like,Very slow
