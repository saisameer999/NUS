5.0,An unreasonably fast laptop for a reasonable price.,"I'm not going to post a super long review, just what I cared about, what this laptop is, and what it isnt."
5.0,Good Gaming laptop for a Budget,"Chances are you know a bit about computers if you've made your way through all of the laptop options to this guy.  If you are new to buying computers, I will break down some of the specs, what they mean, and what I feel their value is.  If not, scroll to the end for my final thoughts."
1.0,Overheating,"Not sure whether the thermal paste is badly applied, or this laptop just sucks. But it has serious issues with overheating. I was consistently hitting temps of 90C+ and hit spikes of 98C quite a few times. The laptop shut down twice because it maxed at 100C. This is happening with the fan on MAX and the GPU set to NORMAL, not even overclocking."
4.0,A hot laptop - literally and metaphorically.,"I was in the market for purchasing a laptop.  I travel to conventions, LAN parties, and for work, so I'd like to have a really mobile gaming PC."
1.0,"Good components, horrendous thermal management.","I wanted to like this laptop. However, the heating issues are irredeemable and I’m returning the laptop."
5.0,For the price you can't get any better than this,"This is an extremely high performance laptop with a few of the expected cons of being in this price range (battery life, limited storage out of the box, can get quite hot). Overall the pros far outweigh the cons and I feel great about the purchase. It runs newer games extremely well on high settings without any kinds of performance issues. If you want to get full use of the beautiful 144 hz screen you might need to turn a few graphical settings but it's well worth it. I should point out that I did initially have some heat issues with this laptop where temperatures would consistently be above 90c on demanding games which caused throttling and massive frame drops. I fixed this by undervolting the CPU by 100 MV using throttlestop and running the fans at max speed during gameplay. This has completely solved the issue for me. If you wanted to you could also apply a quality thermal paste or buy a cooling pad but it's probably not necessary."
5.0,Definitely Worth Your Money As Long As You Can Bring The Temp Lower,"I was very skeptical on getting this machine at first as I haven't had any Acer ""gaming"" laptop before and saw many people complaining on Acer gaming machine but I couldn't find any other laptop that offer more bang for your buck than this so I gave it a try and... yes I have zero regret for choosing this over the rest. Actually I'm very much happy with this purchase BUT I wouldn't recommend this laptop for people who doesn't like to tinker with their brand new laptop or have no idea how to improve the cooling efficiency because this laptop gets HOT at stock when playing game at very high graphics settings."
4.0,Powerful Gaming Laptop - Great Price,"I purchased this laptop to be my gaming device while I'm travelling. So far I have tested Battle Field 1 and Guild Wars 2 and was able to play at Ultra/Highest settings on both games at 60+ FPS (BF1 - Averaged 75 FPS, GW2 - Averaged 70 FPS). All of this was done without using the available overclocking that is configurable with Acer's PredatorSense software. I purchased a 1 TB Samsung 860 EVO SSD to install in the 2.5"" bay. After installation I found that the SATA+Power connector had a broken PCB (circuit board). I contacted Acer's support and within 30 minutes they had put in an order to ship me out a new SATA+Power cable. I would like to note for those less technically inclined, they did offer for me to return the laptop and receive a completely new one. Since I know my way around a motherboard I chose to just replace the cable myself. So far I'm very pleased with this laptop, for those who complained about the keyboard getting hot, this is a common issue on all gaming laptops. It can simply be fixed by setting the fan speed to max when playing video games. I just finished a 2 hour session of Battle Field 1 multiplayer and my keyboard is just slightly above room temperature. I have listed what I liked about the machine and what I didn't below as well as a summary of my review."
1.0,Buyers beware,"We recently purchased this laptop for my son. He needed it  immediately because he was going away for college. When we received the laptop, it did not power-up. We immediately contacted Acer for technical support . Acer tech team recommended to send it back for repair. It's been 3  weeks and we still have not received the repaired laptop.. In the mean time, my son left for college without his needed laptop. THIS IS SOO FRUSTRATING.. UGH!!  If anybody from  the ACER team reading this review.. PLEASE HELP!!"
1.0,Horrible Thermal Issues, Pros:
5.0,Best thing I bought this year!,I do not know what to say about this.Can a laptop get any better than this one with this price range? NO! Absolutely not.
4.0,Great Laptop for a Price - Comprehensive Review,"Hello Everyone,"
1.0,Buy at your own risk!,"Based on several reviews I saw, I was hesitant to buy this laptop. I still decided to give this laptop a chance. Big mistake! After a week of using the laptop, the wireless driver randomly stopped working for no reason. Reinstalled the drivers, reinstalled windows, and still wireless drivers wouldn't work. I had no access to a wired connection for days, so eventually plugged it and updates fixed the issue. However, I returned the laptop to avoid such issue happening again. So I got a replacement and guess what? A week after using the replacement laptop, blue screen of death! Error message saying FAULTY_HARDWARE_CORRUPTED_PAGE. Unacceptable that two brand new Acer laptops have issues. The pictures speak for themselves. Though it restarted and seemed to work fine, I was not going to risk having faulty hardware. Acer customer service wanted to send it for repair, which would take 2-3 weeks to receive back. I decided not to deal with them and returned everything back to Amazon. Thankfully, everything happened within the return period and Amazon's great customer service accepted with no issues. Instead, I bought the HP Omen 15 and couldn't be happier! I'm sure Acer makes some good laptops, but this specific product has lots of issues! If you do end up getting this laptop with no issues, consider yourself lucky. It has great specs for the price. Start up is blazing fast. Upgrading hard drive and RAM is super easy. Screen is great except for that massive screen bleed. Oh and good luck dealing with the terrible thermals and loud fans. Had to reduce the processor power management (advanced settings on Edit Power Plan setting) by like 30-40% to achieve decent thermals. The good thing is Predator Sense software allows full control of fan speed. I apologize for the lengthy review but it had to be said. I suggest to save your money and invest in a better laptop if possible."
5.0,The best gaming laptop you can find at this rate,I recently purchased a gaming laptop that I had to return due to problems to the motherboard so when I started to search for a new one found the Helios 300 model which at the beginning I didn't care much until Acer launched the Helios 300 2018 model which was an instabuy to me.
5.0,Powerful pc for good price,"This is a very powerful laptop. This being the 2018 version, they include the hard drive tray and screws which usually weren't included in recent versions. Upgraded it with a second 500gb 2.5"" Sata SSD."
4.0,First Gaming Laptop,"So, I bought this last month and will list a few issues I've had with it, so that anyone in my position knows what they are getting into:"
1.0,Another Gamble Laptop,I’ll preface this review with saying that I am returning the first one of these laptops that I purchased. What does that mean? The laptop isn't perfect! I'd give it a 3.5 as of now.
5.0,Faster than diarrhea!,So full disclosure... I use This laptop for running software for my CNC and for this purpose is more than sufficient. I'm not a gamer but the video memory and processing is needed for my purposes and this thing is legit.
1.0,Amazon Marketing did not take any response for the promotion code,"Is been a week that am trying to solve it out, about the promotion code for black ops 4 without anyone takes the responsibility. Amazon marketing was always pointing that the manufacturer has the responsibility and from the other side, Acer pointing that Amazon Marketing is managing the promo code."
3.0,Heating and Dropping performance,"First of all, this laptop is a beast with i7 8th Gen and GTX 1060 (not Max-Q). it handled new games (2018) flawlessly in High/Ultra settings. The biggest problem like others have been experiencing is heating issue. Even with the cooling pad (Slopehill, 5 fans), it still produced around low 80s Celsius during game sessions. Therefore, FPS (frame per second) are dropping like crazy. It was making me feel like the CPU and GPU were giving up. I was hyped up when I got this but then was disappointed. It was a big let down when performance dropping because of heating problem. Other than that, 15.6"" IPS 144hz is awesome. This laptop not too bulky for travel at all. With lowest contrast on balanced power, it gave me 5 hours of watching Netflix without any issue. I don't know how that happens when its battery is supposed to last 3-4 hours max. This is a great build for the price at this moment. It makes sense when Acer saved $$$ on material quality along with high end hardware that come with this laptop.  I would recommend this laptop for stationary use with cooling pad and vacuum air exhaust installed all the time to combat the heating problem to avoid performance drop. It is a good buy for the money right now but I had to return it due to the issues above."
1.0,Weak battery. Keeps shutting down.,Read before buying!
1.0,Overheating,"Not sure whether the thermal paste is badly applied, or this laptop just sucks. But it has serious issues with overheating. I was consistently hitting temps of 90C+ and hit spikes of 98C quite a few times. The laptop shut down twice because it maxed at 100C. This is happening with the fan on MAX and the GPU set to NORMAL, not even overclocking."
1.0,Great laptop when it works...,"The laptop arrived on time and was well packaged. The first day I was able to use it the 300 exceeded my expectations. It's a lightweight laptop with a terrific screen. The exterior looks real enticing and gives it that ""gamer look"". The SSD it came with was only 256 GB so I installed my Steam games on an exterior SSD. When I closed it and later reopened the laptop the screen did not come back on. I let it sit for about 10 minutes and tried again and the screen came back. In the short time I had it I was able to play some games on it such as Dead By Daylight, Car Mechanic Sim 2018 and Rocket League. The laptop played them all with ease for the most part at 60 fps in 1080p, but had some stuttering once in a while. I had this laptop for about a week and was unable to try out another games as the screen blacked out after the logo loading screen popped up when booting up. I was really disappointed, but thankfully Amazon offered me a full refund and I am going to purchase a different laptop. This was the first and possibly last Acer product I will ever buy."
4.0,Honest Review By Casual User & GTX 1060 6GB,GTX 1060 6GB I7-8750H 15.6” HD Model
5.0,Not just for gamers,"What attracted me to this laptop was the processing power and speed. I need a new laptop for work and this one checked off everything on my wish list (with the added HDD). I read all the reviews and heeded the warning about overheating so I got a matching laptop fan and this laptop is so fast, the resolution is awesome, the back lit keys (only come on when plugged in) look so cool. We are still getting to know each other but I have the highest hopes for the Predator. Admittedly it has been a while since I bought a new laptop I am a little starry eyed. I installed the HDD with help of a YouTube video - NOTE: inside the box with your power cord is a tiny bag of 4 screws this is for the HDD installation. I highly recommend."
5.0,"144hz, 1060 gtx & i7-8750h version","I don't often even write reviews, i have to be compelled by a superior experience, or an abysmal experience.  anything that falls in the middle isn't worth the white noise."
5.0,FAST!,"This is a fantastic laptop. The keyboard is very fluid, the screen is beautiful, and the CPU & GPU are extremely fast. I'm loving the load times with the NMVe SSD as well. I researched laptops on Reddit for a few months before deciding on this one. For the money this will beat out most laptops <$1500. PredatorSense is pretty cool too in that you can overclock the GPU and increase fan speed super easy. Only two downsides so far that I see are no mini display port meaning I can only pull 60hz on a second monitor with HDMI. It's also a little on the heavier side. Two very small cons to a overall amazing computer."
5.0,Great value for a gaming laptop,"I'm not going to wax poetic here -- I just wanted to put in a plug for this machine. I've had mine for a little over a week and I just love it. The price is unbeatable for what it is -- GTX 1060, 144Hz screen refresh (!), lots of RAM, SSD... My only beef was the 250GB SSD, but I added a 500GB SSD into the 2nd slot for under $80."
1.0,Meh,USB-C is a data only port
3.0,"Probably the most power you'll find for the price, but...","ADVICE: IF YOU BUY THIS LAPTOP, IMMEDIATELY UPDATE THE INTEL SSD FIRMWARE AND DRIVERS. The Intel SSD Toolbox software that's freely available on Intel's website should identify and fix the issues I had before they cause you the same headache."
5.0,Buy with appropriate expectations,Advice:
4.0,"Runs all games good, except CSGO",EDIT: UNDERVOLTING IS A MUST. This is something that could take it from a quick return to a laptop you love.
4.0,"Fast machine, easy to upgrade, some tinkering required",I have had this laptop for a couple weeks and here are my overall thoughts.
3.0,No black Ops,"permitanme citar lo que se ofrece en el prmer literal de las caracteristicas del producto: ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 with Purchase - Valid 10/21/18–04/31/19"". Es el caso que en ese numeral se promulga que se recibira un correo dentro de una cantidad determinada de dias posterior a la compra, actualmente ya paso el perio de tiempo que menciona y hasta el momento he recibido el correo lo ofrecido. es por este motivo que les pongo en conocimiento de lo sucedido,  ademas solicito al personal de amazon me puedan solucionar el tema. e"
5.0,"Looks good, easy to add hard drive/memory, great performance...","Just got it, runs great, no complaints. Really nice display, sharp and vivid, it's not retina, however, gaming on retina display would require a crazy video card that probably wouldn't fit into a laptop. I bought he hard drive bundle, and it took less than 5 min to install the hard drive, just unscrew hard drive lid (one screw), then unscrew the hard drive cover (4 screws), then connect the hard drive and put the cover and lid back on. Great stuff."
5.0,Braced for some issues- but extremely satisfied with a Acer on this one!,"Before buying this for my son, I read pages and pages of reviews (I sort by the most recent critical reviews primarily). There were good points raised in some cases, but given the value offered for this nicely configured laptop gaming rig, I went ahead and ordered. To be ignored are the reviews who condemn the product/manufacturer for all eternity because they got a dead one out of the box - (disappointing of course but it happens sometimes)."
5.0,Amazing deal,"I was highly skeptical of this laptop as it seemed like a too good to be true price for the features packed into it, but after 8 weeks or so of tweaking and testing I've managed to figure it out well. Here's my summary:"
5.0,Very Impressed. Better performance and quality than HP Omen 15 and Dell 7577 (G5/G7),"Since November 2018, I've had 6 laptops! I ended up having problems with all of them and had to return. Eventually I settled on this Acer Predator Helios 300 and so far so good. I'm finally happy with my purchase."
4.0,"Extremely fast, but comes w/ a price","Okay so this is probably the most powerful computer I have ever actually had. I turned off my desktop the day it came in and literally have no reason to even turn it back on, because I could gut it and transfer the HD contents to this laptop in less overall time than it would take to simply turn it on."
5.0,the predator- a great laptop for the price,backstory
1.0,Bad experience,"The first time I got this laptop, I found it a little bit laggy when I try to open the setting windows. I updated the driver of GPU then it became better but still noticeable laggy. So for the first few weeks, it worked well, I only use it to play the hero of the storm, it worked well. Unfortunately, when I started to play Battlefield 5, the experience became a nightmare. Inconsistent laggy keeps coming when I play this game. The frame speed dropped rapidly and made the game unable to play. It's a laptop with GTX1060 so there is no reason for it to perform such bad."
2.0,"I supposed it's worth it, if you don't mind thermal throttling during game sessions.","I ordered the Acer Predator Helios 300 and truly wanted to love this laptop to it's core, especially because the price was the best bang for the buck on the market at the time of purchase in August."
4.0,"Good balance of performance / price / quality, but it can run pretty warm","Great for gaming - maybe not running on ultra settings for some titles, but on high it's more than enough. But heat management could be improved... after maybe an hr f gaming, I could feel that the upper-middle to upper middle/right portion of the keyboard gets pretty warm.. you can still touch and keep your fingers on, but the other gaming laptop I had that I returned for other reasons was not as warm.."
4.0,"Powerful and affordable, great for getting into PC gaming!","This laptop was my first jump into PC gaming. I wanted something to edit videos on and also game with, as well as be able to take with me wherever I want. Let me tell you, for $1000 this is one hell of a deal, despite some annoying issues that I will get into later. I'm not gonna pretend like I know a whole lot about the technical details, this is just based on my knowledge and personal experience using this."
5.0,Loaded Laptop,"I just got into playing World of Warcraft and needed a laptop that could perform better that the non-gaming cheap one I was using. My wife has a MSI and used to have a Asus so I thought that was the way I'd go too but the more I looked the more I was drawn to the $1200 version of the Helios 300 with the 8th gen i7, Geforce GTX 1060 and 144hz display."
5.0,Amazing gaming laptop with awesome screen,Amazing laptop.  The upgraded screen on the this model is well worth the extra money.  The screen is much brighter and smoother than the previous model.  It does get warm and a cooling pad helps.  I also undervolted the cpu a little and that kept the temps way down during heavy gaming sessions. The build quality is excellent and adding a second drive helps with large games. Overall very pleased and happy I spent the money on the new model.
4.0,Keys crack!,UPDATE - After talking with Amazon Prime about the issue with the cracked space bar Amazon sent the order back to Acer to be repaired. The Repairs were completed and computer is back and working fine. I changed my rating to a 4 as Acer did fix the keyboard issue with prompting from Amazon Prime. Thanks Amazon Prime you rock!
4.0,Great deal you can find,"This is an upgrade from the 2017's Helios 300, and a good upgrade it is. I got this during Black Friday sale, but been eyeing it for long time. Compare to other laptop with same specs, you are getting a better deal with this. Pretty much a full 144hz display and an overclock i7 chip. The build is quite strong and there is barely any form of flex on both keyboard and display. With the 1060 6GB, you are pretty much getting a full desktop power in a portable system. The keyboard isn't super bright, nor dim. Sadly you can't change the brightness level of the keyboard nor the colors. The track pad is right about the good size and uses standard windows drivers and it has soft clicks, same goes with the keyboard. Having an access to HDD upgrade and Ram upgrade is a great bonus as it is one screw away to upgrade."
5.0,"I'm impressed, which is rare with technology and I","I've had some time to run this laptop through its paces after several weeks testing it out.  I was a bit concerned about the small storage, but it is easy enough to upgrade it or add an SSD or small format mechanical drive for storage needs should that become necessary.  For now, the 240 GB M.2 SSD works at about 60% capacity.  I did find it curious that it runs considerably faster than a similarly equipped tower I have, but that one also has a great deal of hardware and drivers since it serves as the main computer out of 4 for a Boeing flight simulator."
3.0,temperature throttling,"This breaks my heart. This is my 3rd acer laptop in a row. I was expecting outstanding performance without compromise for a good price, like I have previously experienced. This doesn't meet my high expectations that I used to have for acer gaming laptops around 1000-1100. It runs at 95 degrees Celsius (or higher) running heroes of the storm on ANY graphical setting. It doesn't matter if you play ultra or medium, the laptop is going to be very hot. I have a large cooling pad underneath that is elevated by a second unplugged cooling pad. It heats up to the point that it throttles itself and then my gaming experience suffers. This feels like a downgrade from the Acer aspire v17 nitro that just died after 4 years of dependable and outstanding service."
5.0,YOU NEED THIS LAPTOP IN YOUR LIFE,You get 1500.00 laptop for 1100.00 (999.00 on sale) 2018 model is a huge step up from 2017
5.0,"Not as hot as some say, if you know how to tame it.","Yes, this model has overheating issues, when gaming at 120FPS. That said, I define overheating issues as getting close to the safe working temps defined by Intel (100 °C in the case of this laptop) minus a padding zone of 30 °C, this means reaching 70 °C for long periods of time. Which you will definitely notice since the keyboards starts getting hot in the 65 °C neighborhood. If you create a ""Gaming"" battery profile in which you limit the CPU to 99% usage, then you drop the frequency to 2.1 GHz on all cores but never go over 65 °C while only losing a couple of frames (I go from 90FPS consistently to 83-87FPS consistently in BO4 max settings). Another solution (tho a less effective one) is undervolting the CPU, but I found my specific laptop only dropped a few degrees, that is while barely giving away any performance. The keyboard is incredibly comfortable to use for the price point and the screen is great (again, given the price point). Battery life is what you might expect from a gaming laptop, tho again, a battery profile is always useful. In terms of power, it is more than I need then I let it run free, I can easily have a Linux VM using half the threads doing something intensive and have both the host OS and the VM show no signs of lag. The SSD is a bit small but has a great performance (FOR THE PRICE POINT [that seems to be the important thing to remember here]) and adding another drive was extremely easy. All this said, I am still considering repasting the CPU (since ACER is known for cheapening out on the application process and the thermal paste quality) and if I do I'll update the overheating issues."
5.0,"For the price, you get more than usually market offers!","Alright here’s the deal. I have been an HP and Apple customer for over 14 years. Never cheated in those two ever! Now i needed a super mobile, not too expensive, good quality laptop for gaming when i am not home which happens very often! This Predator was kinda of a risky for me, never trusted Acer! Well now i can say that not just changed my mind, I actually think they did a great job! Using high end parts, charging lowest price on the market, get a good looking rig and works really well!"
4.0,"Impressed after a lot of research, comes with everything you need","I don't usually write reviews, but I'm really impressed with this laptop. I've only had it for a few days so I'm keeping an eye on performance."
4.0,UPDATE! Initial issue and replacement,"I'll leave my original review below.  After my initial support/repair request and review on Amazon, an Acer rep got in contact with me and apologized for the issues. They overnighted a new laptop. So far so good! In addition they extend my warranty for the issues and took care of shipping. I'm really pleased with the service I received after my initial issues."
5.0,"Does its job well, just have a small fan blowing on the rear vent always","It is indeed the cheapest among its peers, if compared in equivalent part specs."
4.0,"Runs quite warm, but with some tweaks, is a very good gaming laptop for the price.","My son bought this to use as his gaming computer to replace his 3-year old Acer Aspire. It was recommended by a friend, so after some research, we made the purchase."
4.0,"This product is suitable for my needs, however poorly presented by manufacturers and shippers...","The installation was easy, however the HD port on the bottom has screws that are made of cheap metal, which in turn get left in and cannot be extracted. The cradle the HDD is in for my computer barely worked out, and almost broke during installation."
4.0,Do love this computer,I bought this laptop due to its Power to handle higher end games and art programs. It has good reviews.
5.0,"Great price, some downsides.","One of the best laptops for the price. The laptops does get hot as in 80°c and above when playing Call of duty black op 4. The heat is located at the upper left part of the laptop or in other words at the 1 till 5 numbers and q,w,a,s,d,e keys. I am using a external half keyboard, so I don't really get annoyed about the heat. Sound is good but I am using hyper cloud x. What I really wanted is a thunderbolt on this laptop but unfortunately this laptop doesn't include it. What this laptop doesn't include is a full HD 144hertz screen, which is one of the best screen I have ever used. I don't really recommend to use it on the go, it like a semi desktop where you are able to move it around but it's inadvisable, due to the weight and the risk of damage. One of the best inclusion is the expandable drive which I use a expandable hybrid drive from seagate. The laptop does include some light and unwanted programs, for me personally I didn't disable them, but I have removed the icons and they might be useful later. For me when I got the laptop at 1099$, it was a great purchase and it still is. So if you want a 4 year gaming laptop, this might be it."
4.0,Super fast for Video editing but audio is not very good to my ears.,I love this laptop. But the built in speakers suck. It just sounds bad. I had to get external speakers to get quality audio out of it. Now having said that.  I really like this laptop for the speed and power. I use it for editing with Davinci Resolve. It handles 4k video like butter. I did buy an extra 500gb ssd drive as my second drive for video. I love the feature of just opening up a  few screws and I can insert another drive in minutes.
5.0,Probably the best value for the money in a gaming laptop,I will keep this short:
5.0,"Amazing buy for the price, this CAN'T be beat","(Update: been three weeks since I got this laptop and I'm still having no issues. Predator sense sometimes bugs or, but that's a software issue and I found out how to fix it whenever it does. I also found a solution to the battery problem. There are portable laptop chargers that are about $100 that can keep the laptop charged and running for and extra 6-8 hours depending on the charger's MaH.)"
2.0,"Terrible customer service experience, don't know about the computer yet","So when I got this computer, I turned it on and it turned itself off in about 2.7 seconds. I couldn't figure out what was wrong until I saw that the charging light wasn't on even though it was plugged into the wall."
5.0,Excellent Gaming Laptop,"I have a lot to say about this laptop, but I will try to make it brief. For starters, I would like to say that I have had this laptop for a week now and I upgraded from a 6 year old ASUS with a 4th Gen Intel 17-4500U and a Nvidia 745M. It was a very good laptop and I still use it for school work. But this thing blows it out of the water! I love this laptop, and i'm sure if you are a casual/intermediate gamer like me you will love it too."
5.0,Great gaming laptop!,"Download the Intel SSD toolbox, install the latest firmware and install a Secondary"
5.0,Impressed!,"I bought this for my wife to game on (FALLOUT 76, HOTS, WOW), but I am very impressed with this computer!"
1.0,Way Too Hot it should be recalled!!!,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my son, so it sat for a month almost before it was even removed from the box. Honeymoon period my son didn't really complain but after the return period which ended in January my son had started monitoring things like the CPU temp more closely. At times when the CPU was only under 25 to 35% load the temps were approaching the maximum temp Intel list and it overloaded a few times and shut down. The really sad thing is this was when the temperature control protection was underpowering the CPU to lower the temp. I bought this because I had always had good luck with Acer monitors and people always talked good about their gaming laptops. This laptop is defective from the word go if you actually pay attention. I also just bought a cooling pad so now it has 5 120 mm fans blowing up from the bottom for added airflow. At first, the temps dropped for about a week and now even with the cooling pad it is running at almost 90 F at about 30% load. Just not acceptable, between this and the shit power supply plug on the Acer Aspire R laptop I bought last Spring from the PX on base, I will never buy another Acer computer.  Wish I would have known early enough to return this piece of garbage..."
1.0,Faulty Product. Do not buy,I had nothing but problems from day one. On the very first boot it locked up and had to force shut down. Figured maybe it was just a fluke. Booted back up. Managed to start setting up. Locked up again. Force reboot. Work a bit more. Blue screen of death. Over and over
5.0,Great Gaming Computer,"I bought the Predator Helios 300 over Black Friday weekend 2018 and was a bit anxious before and after the purchase. “Will this be the right laptop?” I thought with some trepidation, or more than once, “God, I’ve made a huge mistake!”"
1.0,DONT BUY IT. ACER SHOULD STOP SELLING THIS UNTIL THEY RECALL IT.,"Well. First of all, i always have been an predator enthusiastic, I bought the old version of the helios 300 (i7-7700hq) and waited for blackfriday to get an upgrade. So, i bought this laptop but then the nightmare has begun. When it arrived, i was looking forward to play csgo and pubg with high settings as I always played in the older version of the same laptop, but with good upgrades."
5.0,"Was doubtful based on the reviews, but glad I bought!","As people have said, yes this thing get super hot! That is no understatement. The only thing you need to do is make sure you turn fans on maximum during gaming and leave on auto during normal work. When you're not gaming, it is absolutely silent and I can hardly tell whether it is on or not."
3.0,Good but be cautious!,"I bought my Helios in October, it is great in everything, really. But before buying from outside US be cautious because its warranty isn't global, for example here in the country of Georgia (Europe) they do not support warranty. Also, from the very beginning this laptop has issue with RAMs noise. For some it's very strange to hear, but yes, RAMs of my laptop have buzzing sound that changes simultaneously with my activity (i.e. while scrolling in web or etc.)."
5.0,Is it possible to fall in love with a laptop?,....I think it is possible to fall in love with a laptop 'cause I'm thinking of asking this one to marry me :p
1.0,This thing is a space heater. Update:  Acer will not pay for shipping to repair under warranty!,"Update: After a few more weeks of gaming since my first review, the Predator now reaches CPU temps of 99C within 10 minutes of playing games like Overwatch on the lowest settings possible, with all recommended options for lowering temps enabled. This puts it into a throttling mode which causes lag and makes games mostly unplayable. I contacted Acer to inquire about a repair, as something is obviously wrong with the system. Upon opening a ticket, I got a nice email with their recommendations for shipping the laptop back to them - with no shipping label or postage paid for. Honestly, I expected more from a $1k+ laptop, but I'm not sure why. Look, I'm sure this is probably a bad unit, but a quick Google search shows that it's a very common issue, and the way it's handled has been poor enough to make it not worth it to even try with this. If you must get a laptop, don't get something like this. The $800 laptop I had before this could play games much better, as it wouldn't get as hot and have to throttle."
1.0,This just made me lmao,"So when it just came, everything was perfect. Looked good, powered up good and functioned good. But the wifi fails to connect after 3 or maybe 4 days of playing league of legends, a game which literally requires no graphic & memory & CPU performance. Overheating? Yes but I'm fine with it. Noise? Yes I'm fine. Other detail issues? Yes but I'm still fine. But it is not cool at all when your internet component started to fail at a rate of 1/5minutes and ended up with 1/minute. You know what is even funnier, I cannot even upload a picture because the wifi just constantly fail when I am literally writing this review. At first I thought it might be my wifi, but I contacted RCN and troubleshoot it, and then at the mean time I switched back to my Mac and the game went perfectly fine. So I thought it might work this time, but ended up with an EPIC FAIL. I also updated my network card drive and ended up even worse. Well I am not blaming Acer but I do wanna say thanks for ruining my winter vacation. Going back to college now lmao. Oh and another thing, I cannot submit this review now because I am disconnected. Wish me luck on submitting this review. God bless me, and god bless the USA and China. Oops, internet is back!"
5.0,More bang for the buck,"After reviewing a bazillion laptops and checking reviews after reviews, I finally settled on this bad boy.  For less than a $1,000 (score one for sales) and getting Amazon payments, I couldn't be happier.  Some of the reviews are accurate far as high temps during gaming. I would expect that as you are imitating desktop level specs in a tiny case that just can't provide the proper level of cooling."
5.0,"Great screen, great for gaming, heating issues can be easily fixed by undervolting.","Screen Quality: Excellent. 144 Hz, 1920 x 1080 pixels. Screen looks excellent for the price. Youtube and games look great on this screen. Big enough and completely suits all my needs for gaming and watching videos. A lot of laptops in the same price range only have a 60 Hz screen. While that's decent, the fact that this one is 144 Hz is pretty impressive."
5.0,budget gaming laptop,Pros:
5.0,"If you are having heat issues, please read this","Purchased this rig after extensive research and so far I'm very happy with it. Laptop was overnighted in sturdy packaging. It took me about an hour to update windows and all the drivers, download discord and twitch and shut down all the unnecessary start up crap and clear the bloatware."
1.0,"Crashes right out of box.  Updated after Acer ""repair""","Have had laptop for 3 days.  Laptop has crashed with critical errors and is restarted.  Upon restart, screen says ""No Bootable Device"".  Acer recommended to enter BIOS and reset the system settings to default.  After doing so, laptop crashes with same problems while I was on hold with Acer."
3.0,Great for the price!,"I’ve had this for a few weeks now.  Slightly disappointed in the main solid state drive speed.  Also gets really warm when gaming unless I have the fans cranked up to 6krpm.  Power cable is sufficient to charge while gaming unlike some other complaints I’ve read.  I’m assuming they fixed the low wattage issue.  The screen is amazing at 144hz.  The keyboard is great!  Soft touch, and extremely quiet keystrokes.  Sensitive touchpad.  Has a ton of bloatware and Norton pops up every couple of hours telling me how protected I am and that my lackluster 30-day trial is about to expire.  I do wish it had more ports for HDMI and USB 3.0 and that the USB-C port was thunderbolt compatible.  I misread that part.  The graphics card is great but needs to be set to use instead of the integrated graphics (but that’s not uncommon).  The battery life is pitiful though, and it’s built in so I can’t buy a spare to swap out or upgrade.  All in all it’s a great laptop for the price!  And I was able to break it up into payments and that made it even more affordable."
5.0,If you can’t take the heat..,"This thing is a beast straight out of the box, and with some upgrading will get even better! All gaming PCs as powerful as this one are going to get hot.. deal with it, or buy a less powerful machine"
2.0,Awesome components for the money.. but..,"I just bought this laptop 2 weeks ago and really started giving it a go this past weekend. I first installed CSGO being this is really the only game I’m going to be playing on this machine while taking it to Lans, while about hour 1 I started having a throttling stutter issue that would drop the FPS down to about 10 and shoot back up after about 30 seconds. I can't have this if I’m playing comp or any game at that matter seeing how annoying the stutter is. I bought a cooling pad and maxed the fans out after restarting and giving it an hour break but still ran into the issue about 30 mins to an hour in.. I'm at a loss of words I would have preferred a thicker laptop without the cooling issue and the specs instead of having to deal with this on a brand new laptop.  I'm going to contact tech support after the new year and if they can't get this ball rolling I will have to return this and go with a better build quality on another brand I trust. Besides the overheating issue the games play really good and you can't beat the specs for the price. the 144hz monitor is a plus also! I'll update my review after getting the word from tech support."
5.0,Not perfect but pretty close.,"Super impressed for the price I paid($1000USD).  Plays all modern games, no problem.  Because it’s a laptop, the default configuration is to use the built-in GPU on the Intel CPU to save battery; however, the battery and battery charger are pretty bad so you’d never play with this unplugged.  The main impact of this is that the CPU constantly hits mid 90’s on temperature (anything above 80C isn’t great).  This causes a lot of in-game throttling and frame drops.  If you want the most out of this laptop, change your 3D GPU settings from automatic to use only the primary GTX GPU and ensure you are providing sufficient air flow."
1.0,Tons of problems and terrible customer support,"The first time I bought this laptop, it arrived with a malfunctioning key. Acer wanted me to pay for the shipping to have it repaired/replaced (which was quite pricey), and said the process would take weeks, so I replaced it through amazon instead (which only took 2 days and was free). The second laptop I received overheats when playing games (CPU temps average 95 celsius within 5 minutes of playing the witcher 3). Getting that fixed also requires sending it in. But that's not the worst part. One of the keys on my keyboard recently fell off, after 4 months of use. Acer won't send me a new key, and they want me to pay $700 to send my laptop in for repairs. $700 TO REPLACE A &*$@ING KEY. I'll probably never buy another Acer product. This laptop seemed too good to be true, and it was. All those specs at that low of a price came at the cost of terrible manufacturing quality."
4.0,Worth it if you are willing to put in the work.,"As a gaming laptop, this definitely gets the job done with flying colors. You won't have to worry about performance. Easy Ultra 1080p 60+ FPS in games like Doom, For Honor, RE2 REMAKE, and Rainbow Six Siege."
1.0,"Good in principle, bad preformance","The heat is absolutely a problem. For a $1,200 computer to not being able to run CSGO for a full comp match, this was an obvious problem. Fans spinning at nearly 5500 RPM, cpu at over 80 celsius, had to return this because it was so dysfunctional."
4.0,Very happy with purchase,"Got this for the 5 payment deal for Black Friday week, paid $999, after reading tons of reviews about it overheating I went with it as the specs were the best for the price. It does get super hot during high settings gameplay in heavy games, for me it was only during COD Black ops 4 zombies with tons of stuff happening at once. Plays Fallout 4 perfectly without getting hot on high settings. I bought this for video processing and 3D projection mapping, I am running several Adobe apps including Premier Pro, After Effects, VPT8 and more simultaneously with no issues. Video card is super amazing. I added a WD 3D NAND blue 500g SSD from Amazon to it in under 1 minute and now it’s a monster laptop for around $1,035. I’m super happy with it. It feels very very sturdy with its robust metal chassis and the screen is awesome low glare matte finish. Nvidia overclocking is awesome too! This thing is a beast for the price. Chose this over a MSI with same specs for $2k. Happy as heck!"
5.0,Exceptionally Fast Computer... You will be impressed!,"I bought the Acer Predator Helios 300 to run multiple virtual machines for cybersecurity studies.  It is great for that and of course, high-end gaming.  Meanwhile, if you are simply looking for a reliable, well built machine that will flat out amaze you with speed and performance then you have found it.  At first blush, the screen is really beautiful and web pages open faster than you can imagine.  But there is more... Go ahead and play a movie from Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, You Tube, PBS Passport or where ever... Maybe you don't 100% need this machine but if you use it for more than an hour or two, you will never want to go back to slow... Ever!"
2.0,Good pc great price,I’m overall happy with this laptop to the extent that it runs graphic heavy games that I play and it was a very reasonable price with I think $200 off..that being said the one fault I have is that when the fans need to kick into max settings I’m shaken to my core because it sounds like it’s trying to take off. However with the blue tooth option I’m able to listen to music over the sound of this aircraft carrier
5.0,Replaced my main desktop,"I had been waiting indefinitely for video card prices to come down after the bitcoin bubble, and the Helios 300 allowed me to get a 1060 and 144Hz screen at a competitive price compared to a new desktop. The two drawbacks are obvious: heat management and battery life. Compared to any other similarly priced laptop, this thing sucks down power and dies in 4 hours; it's expected and I simply expect to be plugged in if I'm using much CPU/GPU. As for heat management, I've got Throttlestop downvolting the CPU as many in the reviews for this laptop have done, I use fan management software, I have a cooling pad, and I just accept that the fans are going to be loud. Everything else is amazing as advertised: the 144Hz screen with improved color range from previous models, I love the feel of the keyboard and the numpad, the CPU is amazing for any windows tasks and it even has enough RAM to run Chrome."
1.0,Ths laptop constantly overheats and the battery last only about an hour.,"I've had this laptop for only 6 months and it overheats all the time. Not even while gaming, just using your browser, etc. This means the laptop constantly shuts down, without a warning..! And you have to let it cool down before turning it on again (it won't turn on otherwise) It's too expensive of a laptop to have this bad of an issue. On top of that, the battery life is very poor. It last about an hour. I would not recommend this product."
5.0,Amazing gaming laptop!,"Man oh man is this an awesome gaming laptop. Been playing a lot of classic games from Steam on it like Hitman, Splinter Cell and Deus Ex. The screen is gorgeous to look at. Nice and bright with amazing colors. Since it came with an SSD everything loads super fast. Seconds after pressing the power button I'm already at the main screen. It's so awesome. I did have to buy an external SSD tho since I wanted more space but it was really easy to install one. I recommend the samsung evo 500 gigs one. The trackpad I'm not a big fan of because it feels a little hard to use sometimes but that is not a big issue anyway because I bought a usb mouse. As for the overheating problem that people talk about I mostly play classic games on it so I never run into any overheating issues. I did try Skyrim with an ENB tho and it started getting way hot. I'm sure there are some ENB settings I can tweak to calm it a little but other than that if you're like me and mostly play classic games that don't demand intense CPU usage then this laptop will work wonders! Super satisfied with it!"
2.0,Not What I Expected For The Price,This laptop has some very extreme pros and cons to it for me so far.
4.0,"Good hardware, but needs fine tuning to work well",After about a month of usage as primary computer. Tuning details in the end
5.0,Great price but should notice the overheating issue,Pros:
5.0,Amazing Laptop After Tweaks,"I've now owned this laptop since Feb'19 and rolling into May now. I will agree with others comments that this laptop can handle pretty much any game currently on the market, PUBG APEX The Division Etc. It will NOT handle this well out of the box though. You absolutely need to under volt the CPU otherwise it gets too hot. The GPU/CPU is located right under the W and 3 keys which playing any of the games noted above will be serious issues where it is uncomfortable to hold move forward down for extended periods due to being hot to the touch.  Gaming will push to 95 degrees."
4.0,Really good gear for everything you need to do,"Hi everyone, I’m from Panama, everything came as described, wasn’t damaged at all, I received it a couple of days ago but decided to wait to do the review."
1.0,TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!,"While playing a very normal game online through my browser during the first couple of days of receiving the laptop , the laptop freezes and screen went blue indicating a restart, then screen turned black with a message saying ""No Bootable Device"""
5.0,Amazing bang for the buck.,"Screen: beautiful, bright, and obviously 144Hz."
3.0,"Does what it is ""intended"" to do, but its intentions were poor.","This really is an okay laptop. The price was great but the price really shows. The USB ports are disappointing, there is only one USB 3.0 port. If you are expecting to be able to play demanding video games in long sessions, this is not the laptop for you. The AC Adapter is woefully under powered and the laptop often exceeds the power that is able to be delivered to it making long gaming sessions impossible. Its boggles the mind why they make gaming laptops with underpowered adapters ones that are this thin. They are gaming laptops, not mainstream laptops. If they are truly meant  to be portable desktop replacements. They need to be able to properly cool themselves, have adequate power supply, have a good USB ports, and have a microphone and headphone jack. For a supposed gaming laptop. It doesnt seem to target gamer very well. Until it can be figured out, gaming laptops have no business being ultra thin, or this thin. Cooling solutions simply can not handle it. The rating I gave this is at my view generous as it is. So to conclude a plea to Acer. Either make thicker laptops so they are able to properly cool themselves and so they can take advantage of their full power. Or not be considered by serious customers."
4.0,Powerful laptop for a decent price.,"Purchased this laptop less than a month ago, and enjoying it. Came as advertised with the extra caddy, screws and everything. My framerates are amazing, and I play most games on Ultra (automatic settings) when available. The laptop does get hot, which is expected of a gaming laptop, as is the low battery life. If you're ok with using it as a stationary laptop with limited movement then you'll be just fine."
4.0,"It is perfect as a LAPTOP, which is BAD for gaming.",The device itself is perfect.
4.0,Low price and good quality,Acer predator helios 300 (2018)
5.0,Nice laptop,"First of all, gotta put out there that the etched finish it has gives you like a vibrating feeling when you rub it."
3.0,Buyer Beware,"Received a model that does not include the caddy/bracket and cable for 2nd hard drive.  This was pretty disappointing.  I immediately contacted Acer chat and the person there was unable/unwilling to help me and told me there was nothing that they could do.  After receiving a message from the manufacturer, I placed a called and a very helpful customer care representative made arrangements for me to get the kit in the mail.  She was unable to tell me why I didn't get the kit pre-installed but theorized that it was an older computer that Amazon had in stock from before they were included.  We'll see how that goes."
5.0,Great laptop at such a bargain,"Love the laptop. Had it for about 3 months now with no issues. Such an upgrade from my old used one - and at a bargain too. If you've never seen 144Hz, it's eye candy. It makes 60Hz look jagged and laggy. Haven't had much trouble running any of my games on max settings except for latest games. Fans run a little loud on max and gets a little hot, so just be aware when really pushing it on triple A games or trying to overclock. But it's a small price for a great deal and specs. Other than that no groundbreaking flaws or performance issues. The only other thing I can think of is that the chassis gets fingerprints easily."
4.0,*FrameRate*,This laptop does lots of things good. But not really anything great.
2.0,Dont upgrade bios,"I got this laptop, the Predator Sense didn't work. I can not see what the GPU is doing."
4.0,Great for the price -hate the look personally and the bloatware,"For the price this is a very solid machine - I don't do a ton of really heavy gaming but do play some and it has preformed great. I also use it for solidworks and 3d printing and it's been more than enough for my hobbyist requirements. I love the feel of the keyboard and it has a nice screen. Personally I think the look is terrible , it loos like a 12 year old designed it... it's too angry and looks like it's trying too hard... I also don't really care so it's all good as I will not use this for business use and prefer my XPS15 in both size, looks and portability. The bloatware is also a pain for a minute until it's all gone."
5.0,Small and Powerful.Just buy it !!,"Been using this laptop for gaming tried the division 2 ran all settings on ultra getting 60-80 fps, fornite on ultra 140fps ,CS:GO 170-180 fps on ultra.I added 2tb firecuda for game storage.This system run everything I throw at it.Yes it does get warm during gaming ,I set fans to max with cool boost and have no issues.Boot time from off to desktop is about 10 seconds.Also really like the metal lid and around the keyboard."
5.0,PERFECT FOR INTENSE GAMING AND COLLEGE CLASSES!!!,"I DID QUITE A BIT OF RESEARCH ON THIS LAPTOP BEFORE BUYING IT AND I AM SUPER IMPRESSED BY IT, HAS PLAYING NO MANS SKY AT HIGHEST RES SETTINGS AND IT WAS FLAWLESS, BOOT UP TIME IS ALMOST NOTHING, THE LAPTOP DOES GET A LITTLE HOT WHILE PLAYING FOR A WHILE BUT I JUST USE THE PREDATOR SENSE APP TO MAX OUT THE FAN SPEED AND ENABLE COOL BOOST. BEST PURCHASE EVER!"
1.0,Windows Failure,"everything is great except  this windows error  ,"
5.0,Best for the price,"This is the best you can get for the price. I've had no problem running any games. It boots up super fast because of the SSD. I'm not sure how people are having overheating problems. I haven't had any, even running triple a games. Just be sure to set the fans to max and turn on coolboost through the predator sense if need be. I can't speak for durability because I've only owned it for a month and a half but this is the best you can ask for in a laptop for this asking price."
4.0,"Runs hot, extremely hot, you can not use this laptop for gaming unless you make alterations.","This laptop is great for the price, but you better be able to re-paste the CPU and GPU with a high quality paste (don't attempt liquid metal pastes unless its a stationary unit) and you will need to undervolt it to specified criteria based on your model. But upon opening your laptop to repaste you need to know what you are doing before hand. This is not a task for an unexperienced user. We are able to get such high performance from this laptop using third party voltage limitators  and repasting ourselves. If you can't afford the $500 for the next version this is a great option if you are willing to put in the work to make it functional. It is cheaper because you have to invest about $50 to make it usable and your own time and expertise in modifying your laptop. However, Acer's warranty won't cover any potential mistakes and you will be left with a high powered streaming device instead of a gaming laptop if you screw up opening and re-closing your laptop."
5.0,Best bang for your buck at the moment.,"I got this laptop 20% off. For current gen and “pro” games I can get get 60 FPS in everygame be warned that a 1060 will NOT get you 144 FPS in all current gen games unless settings are tweaked to the lowest possible. Games like Diablo 3, overwatch, fortnite run at above an average of 100 FPS with settings at high to max. I tested black ops 4 all modes run at 60 with vsync in with little to no dips (except an occasional glitch where textures would not load right away) I’d say this laptop is amazing for the price right now. The CPU does run hot at times which worries me a little. Acer has made amazing quality laptops for the past 6+ years that my family had used them. The quality of this is great. It’s thinner than my last gen laptop which was an MSI GT60 and I’m impressed. If your looking to get 144 FPS is every game on a laptop at 1080p your going to need to spend another $1000 dollars."
2.0,The Thermals are very Bad,"The laptop meets the performance expectations however it tends to spike up to 95-100 Celsius. This is primarily occurs in actual gameplay and not benchmarking or stress testing software. This occurs with fans set to max output using Predator Sense and using Coolboost enabled. Attempted to use Intel XTU to undervolt the CPU however this has minimal effect and the CPU will still hit above 90 and throttling is still experienced. Suspect this is primarily due to bad thermal pasting job, which I refused to do as it would immediately void both the Amazon and Acer warranty. It's a shame since Acer put a lot of work into adding additional cooling features only to have it negated by poor build/assembly. I will most likely return this and pay a little extra for another laptop with better build quality."
3.0,Having issues with this laptop,"Having issues with this laptop that I am trying to address. I wrote a full review, but then misclicked and lost what I had typed, so for now, I will just say this: The screen is wonderful. The battery life not so much. Issues while gaming that wreck the experience, though while working games look great on this laptop. Having drive reading issues and issues causing games to freeze and force you to power off the laptop."
5.0,Well worth the money and its super fast for a gaming laptop,"I love this laptop but the only issues I have with it is that it gets really hot, while the fans are adequate for cooling the system the keyboard gets very hot around the function keys, number keys and the qwerty key row gets hot enough to cause some discomfort. The battery life is pretty bad it promises 6 hours and I'm lucky if I get 2 solid hours, however I typically keep it plugged in throughout the day as the overclock needs the laptop to be plugged in to work. The keys are amazing for it to not be mechanical probably the best non mechanical keyboard out there currently. All in all its a solid gaming PC it'll run just about anything you want it, with the 2 TB hard drive extension there's enough space to hold all your steam library with ease and the 256 GB SSD runs the whole operating system very fast and with no issues, the last thing is this laptop comes with a face cam and internal mic but I've not found any drivers to run them, that's the strange part of this laptop but its still 5/5."
3.0,Extremely powerful with poor quality.,"This laptop was great for the first few weeks of use. It ran slightly warm but with some adjustments and optimization would stay below 80 degrees on both cpu and gpu temp. However, it is already experiencing BSOD issues and then boots to an error indicating there is no boot drive. A hard power reset will allow it to boot again normally, however it encounters this error within 30 minutes of use now."
4.0,Powerful Beast that demands power supply juice!,"This laptop is a beast. The specs are impressive and it functions like powerful machine. The only downside is battery life which really sucks. The battery drains very fast even for day to day tasks like browsing, music, binge watching and tasks which doesn’t need special power boost. If you solely buying it for gaming then you will need the charger to be plugged in for all the time for two reasons. 1.) as mentioned above, the battery drains very fast and won’t last more than an hour if you gaming. 2.) most importantly, without charger plugged in, the performance is not good at all. FPS drops like crazy for example fortnite without charger caps at 30 fps and with charger it easily do 120 fps (stable) and more."
5.0,Great Laptop - best value for price,"I've been using it for quite a few months now. No issues at all. Zero! All pros. ;P No cons. actually I do take that back. 2 cons. 1) only 3 usb 2.0/3.0 ports. I do like that it has a usb-c, but I don't have any peripherals that use it. 2) the edge where your wrists rest (say that ten times fast) is a bit sharp."
5.0,Perfect for Sims 4,"This is my first gaming computer of any kind. I didn't know what to expect. I was just hoping for better graphics than my old Lenovo Ideapad would allow. I was also hoping that my game would load quicker. I was shocked at the graphics on this laptop. And it takes probably less than 3 minutes to go from desktop to playing my game. I have no idea what half of the features even mean because I lack in the area of technological knowledge, but I do understand that it comes with an HD screen - which it awesome. I use my Predator for Sims 4, browsing the internet, and streaming videos and movies. I can't speak to the quality of gaming for other games (because I don't play other games), but this laptop is AMAZING for Sims 4. I enjoy playing with custom content and I've had zero issues with the amount of content that I continue to pile into this things memory. On my old Lenovo, I would literally have to wait a solid 5mins for the screen to pop up after clicking the icon on my desktop. Then an additional 10 actual minutes for it to open up to the games Home Screen. Then another 5-10 mins for it to load my family. The lag on my old Lenovo was absolutely terrible. In comparison to the piece of junk I was playing on before, the Predator Helios 300 is amazing. The tasks flow seamlessly. All I could think about was a sharp knife sliding through butter as I discovered the wonder I had been missing. My game loads in what feels like the blink of an eye. There's no lag at all. Downloading custom content is super fast (especially considering I download massive amounts of content at one time and throw it in a zip file). The quality of my gaming experience has improved so dramatically with this laptop that I honestly don't think I could ever go back to anything else - let alone a none-gaming laptop. 100% buy this if you're on a budget and are addicted to Sims. I'm doing the payment plan through amazon prime. It was worth every single penny the second I got past Cortana's annoying setup routine (which was super fast and easy BTW)."
1.0,Big problem on overheating,Anytime I’d play just about any game for 5-10 minutes the cpu would gets up to around 99 degrees  Celsius and I’m no scientist but I don’t think that should be happening.
1.0,Hot and Loud,"I know it can be hard to find a laptop that has decent cooling, but this one is just awful. The CPU and GPU share the same exhaust pipe and the CPU runs insanely hot."
5.0,I love this laptop,"We got this on Black Friday and I was hesitant because I’ve not had much luck with Acer products in the past. And I disliked the advertised screen resolution but boy was I wrong. The type of display it is is crisp, clear and bright and seems like a much higher resolution than it actually is. This allows me to play anything maxed out. I’m currently playing Hitman 2 on max settings, as well as far cry 5. So far we haven’t had a lick of problems with ours after 3 months of constant use. Very pleased with my purchase. This blows the Dell gaming laptop I previously owned out of the water (and it was just as much)."
2.0,Not A Good Gaming Laptop,"For gaming this laptop is terrible, it throttles so much and tech support couldnt help me with anything to fix it. I would go from 200 fps down to 5 fps and have it stay there for 20 - 30 seconds which is terrible for playing a competitive game. My laptop thermal throttles and power limit throttles. Undervolting does nothing either. This laptop pushes itself to its fullest potential but once it goes over its fullest potential it keeps going and causes it to throttle. I got this laptop for mostly gaming and I would rather continue playing on my $400 laptop from 2 years ago then play on this."
5.0,"Great PC, large learning curve for average consumers",Absolute great price to power ratio on this computer if you are willing to work with it a bit. There are a few things that need to be done in order for this computer to run as it's intended to.
5.0,Good value with some modifications.,Only two problems with this device I have found in my weeks of use. Initially starting up my graphics card was set to default as Intel's graphics chip. Which also included games. Ita a power saving features to switch between rendered but mine was not switching for games. But it was easy to switch it in nvidia settings.  Number 2 thermal throttling was a noticable problem. The solution I decided to go with was getting graphite pads. And alternative to heat paste with a slight risk sense they are conductive. Not difficult to pop open if you got the right tools and if you can change out thermal paste at the very least it is a great value laptop.
2.0,EXPECT OVER HEATING,"I received this laptop just 3 days ago expecting to have an all around strong system that could withstand high settings (not ultra) when gaming. I quickly found out that the cooling system couldn’t not keep the CPU under 90 degrees Celsius with the fans on max settings, a 5-fan cooling pad, and a circulation fan on my desk. Additionally the computer crashed the first day I got it as well as constantly restarting due to “DCP WATCHDOG VIOLATION”- a driver issue. I was highly disappointed in the laptop’s performance and already returned it. Amazon was very helpful with that transaction. However, I don’t recommend this laptop as it seems very spotty in customer experience. I’m going to listen to what I’ve heard from the beginning and build a tower instead. I’m not one to place bad reviews but if I can save someone else from the trouble then it was worth it."
4.0,Great gaming Laptop for the most part!,"I really really do love this gaming lapop! Except I have a few complaints. First off everything spec wise is really great for the amount of money it costs. But the display is a little more flimsy than I would like it to be. Also it's heat management is horrendous. I read the reviews about it being bad, but it's terrible. I bought a cooling fan to place under the laptop, and even with that on as well as the laptops fans set to Max (with cool boost on) it still reaches about 80°F. And the keys especially around the WASD area becomes really uncomfortable to work with because of the heat. Which is unfortunate considering WASD are the main keys for most PC Games. It also seems to have trouble keeping steady frames after longer periods of time. The track pad also doesn't seem like it's very sturdy but it's accurate enough at least. Those are really my only complaints. I think spec wise though the Laptop is amazing."
1.0,Great laptop BUT Screen is flickering...,"Just bought this laptop and it arrived yesterday. I can confirm this laptop is great for everything I need it to do, it runs games amazing and is very fast. The problem is with the screen and it being a new product I wouldn't expect something like this to be a problem. The screen flickers almost like an old TV without service, it doesn't effect the way the laptop performs at all except it is something that shouldn't be there. It happens when the laptop is under a little stress, for example on the internet or playing games essentially anything I do on this laptop it flickers. Tried updating drivers and no one else has this problem which makes me believe that I just have a bad Apple. Hopefully with this one being returned and receiving another one I can fully enjoy a great laptop without any problems."
3.0,Honest Review,"Won't be sugarcoating it, a really good laptop, I used it for about two weeks then just lost touch for it. I am a gamer and I go to college, thought I can have both, but I was wrong. The computer is very well built, and the parts are amazing for the price. The one and only problem I had with this laptop was the battery, I saw that lots of people said 3 hours and I thought I'd work with that, but instead, it never reached two hours, I would always charge my laptop, sometimes 4 times a day, and that was a really big inconvenience for me, otherwise, I loved everything."
5.0,Great so far!,"Loving this laptop so far. Great gaming performance. However as others stated it runs hot. It seems all laptops with this processor have this issue, its a chip that runs hot. The best solution Ive (and others) have found is too use a program called throttlestop and undervolt the I7 8750H a little bit. It wont hurt the chip or performance at all and now under max load my CPU never goes above 85C. There are plenty of tutorials online to show you how to do it. I do highly recommend this laptop."
5.0,Seems to be a great laptop out of the box after a few tweaks,"I just got this laptop today after getting it for Cyber Monday. I will post a follow up after I've had the chance to use it a couple weeks. For others like me that got it on Friday or Monday, the very first thing I did out of the box was to uninstall all of the bloatware, especially Symantec. That made the laptop feel significantly snappier. Text scaling comes set at 125% by default, which I absolutely hate. I set that to 100% and it makes the screen look SO much bigger. Updated the Nvidia driver and began to install Steam and games. I'll give it a try and see how it goes from there."
4.0,Muy buena pero...,"La computadora en sí es una obra de arte, pero me encontré con este detalle cuando le intenté agregar un nuevo disco duro en la recamara que trae. Quienes son muy delicados lo verán como un problema grande. Mucho ojo en revisar su aparato una vez recibido, lastimosamente he traído la laptop a otro país fuera de donde la compre y se me hace imposible devolverla. Por lo demás me parece una buena inversión. Lo que si esta claro es que se calienta demasiadisimo. Se soluciona con un undervolting."
5.0,Best gaming laptop in this price range!,"If you're looking for a quality gaming laptop on a semi-budget, this is it. Most other laptops in this price range, do not offer the same specs or screen quality."
5.0,Was a bit worry at first now now I’m loving my Predator Helios 300.,"I’m new to PC and Windows 10. First gaming laptop. Got this laptop because I want to be able to Game (Tekken 7/SFV/Sekiro/Etc) on the go when traveling or going to work. The laptop does get pretty hot when playing Sekiro at temps 85°-90°. When it gets hot like that, the game stutters for 5-10 seconds. The other games runs fine at 75°-80° so no issues there. So I had to YouTube and Undervolt my CPU using ThrottleStop and now it’s working flawlessly. The battery isn’t too great so it’s recommended to play games with the power plugged in. Or you can use the battery too but you’ll have to set your game settings to be “Low”."
1.0,Awful Heat management,Had the laptop for less than three months now and It's running at 65 degrees when idle(in an AC cooled room to 20degrees) and started to thermal throttle when playing any game other than league(constant temperatures of 95+). Will probably have to repaste/thoroughly clean any dust inside the laptop and hope for the best. Wouldn't recommend buying.
