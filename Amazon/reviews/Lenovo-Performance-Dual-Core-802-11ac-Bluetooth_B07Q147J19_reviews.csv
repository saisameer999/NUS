1.0,Windows 10 S Mode,computers arrive with Windows 10 S Mode !! The big difference between Windows 10 S and any other version of Windows 10 is that 10 S can only run applications downloaded from the Windows Store !!
5.0,"Good value, windows 10s easily changed","Great cheap laptop. It was sent to me with windows 10s, but with a quick Google search you can change it to regular windows 10 by going into your settings."
5.0,Best value for $250- fast,"For $250 this is a powerful and fast machine. Does all the basics like email, web searching, Facebook, excel. I really got it to play online games that require more intense graphics and gameplay. I am very happy with its value. I bought one with only 4Gb RAM from A local retail store for $200 but it was super slow. This Lenovo also starts right up after a reboot.  Well worth the money."
5.0,Great basic laptop for the price!,Replaced a Dell basic laptop that was a few years old but ran windows 10. My dell died when the keyboard drank a cup of coffee: >) So I found this laptop for 250.00 on Amazon and I must say it is as good or better then the Dell. I am happy so far with the laptop it even has a DVD player which most are dropping. I don't watch DVD's but do use the player to record data to DVD's like photos and other data. I don't game online so can't say it is good for that probably not first pick for that but as a general use for people like me who mostly read emails and news online it is perfect!
5.0,Surprisingly great for the price,"This laptop is not the most powerful thing you'll use, but for $250, it's excellent for Office applications and basic internet browsing like checking your email and watching 720p/1080p videos (1080p video stutters a little bit on some websites), and the SSD really makes a HUGE difference in performance, it boots up in a couple of seconds, and everything feels snappy even though the CPU is kinda weak and it only has 4GB of RAM."
4.0,Overall a good performing laptop for office tasks,Arrived with Windows 10 Home version 1809. Setup went quickly without issue. Not too much bloatware installed. Speed is adequate to watch videos full-screen in HD. Just don't expect miracles from this budget device.
2.0,ANOTHER RIPOFF,When will I learn. Unresponsive touchpad.  No money tree that I can shake to purchase a better device. This is ridiculous.  Feels like a toy you might win at a carnival for a nickel.
5.0,I think this is good for student or office,The price is worth it and good for student like me.
5.0,Good budget laptop.,Much better than expected.
5.0,Great,I can't believe how nice it really is. This was a refurbished unit. I challenge anyone to see the difference.
