1.0,Beware not what it seems,"After doing the set-up of this laptop , which it took a while to download all the MS updates and installed some of the software I'd bought for it."
4.0,Well known Lenovo Brand Laptop,"I'm pleasantly surprised with the price and performance of this Lenovo IdeaBook laptop. It's perfect for web browser, light office applications and general overall usage. The price was great for what it is and it being a brand new laptop is the major factor for giving this item a try. This was a Christmas gift and so far its working great. I will provide an update if something happens with it. For now, great Lenovo IdeaBook!"
5.0,Extremely easy to set up!,"Lenovo Vantage came pre-installed (which is a very useful program that finds,downloads and installs) any system updates that are available since laptop was manufactured.  Lenovo Migration Assistant is available from Lenovo's website and makes transfer of any files from another computer extremely easy. Large keys on keyboard is a plus as is the number  keypad to the right of the alphabet keys. They offer warranty upgrades that are more reasonable than other manufacturers. I would definitely recommend this laptop to anyone in need of a budget priced one."
1.0,Motherboard Died after 4 Days,It's not the fastest machine on the planet but... for the price it was good enough.  But it just stopped turning on after 4 days.  Lenovo wanted me to send it in and have the motherboard replaced.  I decided to return it instead and purchase a different brand.
3.0,Using one thing at a time and you will be fine,This is a very good looking laptop. and thats's it. Windows 10 really tolls its performance to a point where having 3 programs running at the same time becomes too much.
5.0,Speedy delivery,"Laptop was delivered a day early, and made a great birthday present. Laptop functions as it should no complaints. Thank you!"
5.0,It's Got Pros And Cons.,"Great For Most Things, But It Won't Run Paladins Ir Sea Of Thieves Or Skyrim... Not A New Age Gaming Computer. Though It Will Run Older Games Like Gta 5 On Low Graphics. The Screen Sucks But An Hdmi/VGA Monitor With Hd Optios Will Work."
4.0,Slow but sure,"I wanted another Lenovo, as they're excellent computers, but this was extremely slow, you don't want this if speed in loading is important to you.  I did alot of comparative browsing before going with another Ideapad, and so far it's installing my software fine, just very slowly.  For the money it's a good buy, it has all the basics and the SSD is helpful in case it drops.  It's a bit heavier than I thought it would be, but the screen resolution is good.  I was told by the support person that it had 3 USB ports but it has only 2.  Some of what I was told didn't seem to be accurate but after talking to Lenovo about those details, there's no problem so far.  Delivery was quick, too.  All in all, for the price you're getting a fine laptop you can set-up out of the box.  I've had it a few days, and so far so good!"
5.0,Good value,Worth the money
3.0,The weight and sleekness is great,"I bought the laptop for my business. Scrolling down or up on certain sites is very slow, like it's sticking. Also it is not as fast as was advertised. Battery life is really too short, and the volume can be up a notch or two. All in all not a bad laptop."
1.0,Keyboard is broken,"Super disappointed that the Lenovo Ideapad you sold had a broken keyboard. You had to have tested the keyboard and seen that 14+ keys did not work...why, I have no clue since you state this is a 2019 ""Newest"" Lenovo Ideapad! Bad experience and very, very disappointed."
5.0,Computer rocks,This laptop rocks it updates itself including the bios on it I had an hp before it had nothing on this laptop you can't go wrong buying this laptop
5.0,Let’s see., Making weird noises. Maybe because it’s a PC. I am a Mac user buying this to do coursework for a class I am taking. Hope it didn’t break during its shipment through the polar vortex today.
1.0,Half the keys on the keyboard don't work,"I'm just setting this computer up brand new out of box and half the keys on the keyboard just don't work. It's getting returned ASAP. I also ordered 1 business day shipping because my old laptop is becoming unreliable, and it took two days to get here because I need a reliable computer immediately. All in all, this is a very frustrating experience. I had heard good things about Lenovo but I will never buy another Lenovo product again. Don't buy this laptop!"
1.0,No Keyboard ???,I liked the feel of this Laptop but the keyboard didn't work. Some keys did but not others. I couldn't even put in my password to connect to Wi-Fi to go online. Too bad. I returned it.
1.0,A Kardashian marriage last longer than the battery,"I bought this laptop as a cheap alternative to getting an HP or Dell, just something to get me by for what I thought would be a year or two. Now after two months I realize how bad of an idea that was. Usually Lenovo products are known for surviving like Nokia phones, almost indestructible. When I saw the new IdeaPad, I got excited because of the infamy of the ThinkPad. This laptop isn't that. The battery is completely done, I can't use it to browse online for more than 30 minutes before I get a notification that the bettery is about to run out. If you are looking for an underpowered, cheap desktop substitute, this is perfect. But I would not recommend it as a laptop. Also, it's asking me to rate the touchscreen, there is no touchscreen."
1.0,If you are looking any type of power don't buy this laptop,"Laptop will run and connect to the internet, but is very slow! Working local on Word or any installed apps is also slow. If you have the time to wait, okay you are good, if not look at the Lenovo i5 or i7 which I also own and do the just fine."
1.0,Dead screen. Junk!,Did not work out of the box. Screen was totally dead. Very disappointed. I won’t buy any more electronics on amazon. Lenovo gives you a total automated run around when trying to get tech support. Stay away
1.0,Fast efficent..NOT,Junk
3.0,Muy pero muy lenta,"Aun cuando es un procesador de 2.6 Mz es decepcionantemente lenta, al punto que mande a comprar un disco duro SSD ya que no es nada comodo trabajar con esa eficiencia."
1.0,Mousepad didn't work SUUPER SLOOOW,"After making all the instalation process the mousepad never seem to work, spent 25min with lenovo support (awesome help, and very patient btw) and they determined that it was damaged."
1.0,"I wish to return this ASAP, I got it last week and hate it.","Its very slow, screen resolution is bad,not good for HD also battery is not what is stated in specification, says 5 hours after  full charge and its lasts only 3 hours or so. I had another Lenovo before and was better,this one is slow and heavy."
4.0,good deal,"this laptop has an excellent value for money, good for basic activities like word, excel, power point"
4.0,Great gift,Great for my 8 year old
4.0,Perfect For the Price,"This is a perfect laptop for anyone looking for function without any frills. Its slim, light hardware and small charger are ideal for carrying around. I noticed a slight slow-down when I was streaming HBO and loading a couple of webpages simultaneously, so not the best laptop for someone who needs a lot of processing power."
1.0,Black screen of Death,What a disappointment
1.0,Junk,Returned awful
5.0,Laptop,Day 1 so far so good
1.0,Junk broke 2X,first one powered off and would not power back on when my daughter was doing home work. Amazon replaced it then the replacement did the same thing. No thanks I will buy a better brand
4.0,Highly recommend this product,Easy setup and good battery life. Only issue is that it tends to freeze occasionally when using for prolonged time. So my h needed than the Chrome  Book I purchased previously.
5.0,Perfect!,Great laptop. Works great
1.0,Junk,Complete waste of money. Runs at the speed of a 1984 computer.
1.0,Return,After less than a month laptop wouldn't turn on
1.0,poor item amazon is trying to sell,"after unboxing, i charged it for an hour, turned it on to a constant black screen... doesn't work at all... won't even turn on... my full refund will be spent at Best Buy!"
1.0,Equipo con Teclado Dañado,El equipo llego con el teclado dañado... No le sirven 12 teclas... me gustaria saber si existe algun tipo de garantia aqui en venezuela que pueda aplicar...
