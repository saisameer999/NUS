5.0,Excellent Laptop !!,"Excellent Laptop !! As my current laptop stopped working, I have been looking for a replacement. With the help of my IT friends i understood that Dell Latitude 64xx series is a work horse. Very powerful machine. Little skeptical as this is my first refurbished product in any category. But this company didn't disappoint me. They had sent clear notes on how to boot the machine and register. David even sent an email asking if i need any help. I got 6430 even though amazon description says 6420. Very decent configuration. Hard Drive size is less but you cant ask more in $200 laptop. It comes with 1 year warranty, which is a big plus. Booting is very fast as the hard disk is SSD. Able to setup easily and the laptop was up and running in no time. Overall, i believe this is a very good buy and value for money. Hope Blazing Prices could support if there are any issues. Its been 1 week and the review is based on that. I will come back and write more after few months."
3.0,It's OK a fairly good value. Not much capacity left in the battery.,"I can not complain too much about the value for the money it's pretty darn good. A ~4-5 year old ""kinda"" ok laptop. Mine has a squeaky space key (simple fix with a bit of prying and synthetic lube [plastic safe]), there's crap crammed up in the docking port mount pins (very common in corporate machines), and scuffs along the back, but, I can look past the cosmetics. It is very obvious this machine was leased to some corporate IT department at some point (the leases are usually 4 years) and has quite a few miles on it. It was not supplied with a Dell official power supply, just some cheap knock off, again not a deal breaker, companies often do not return them. The fingerprint reader hardly works but I don't know if it is just the state of the technology when the laptop was produced. The most disappointing thing is that the battery only has about a third of the advertised capacity left in it (see the image). The UEFI says it's time to replace it. I have ordered a new 9 cell battery from a knock off supplier to keep the costs down. It should provide substantially more then the ~1 hour I am getting with the provided one, even if its spec is overstated. Also, when it came 60GB of the 120GB SSD was filled with the OS leaving me with only 60GB for applications and files. Just bear in mind, 120GB ends up being kind of tight after getting the OS and applications setup. I ended up buying a new 250GB SSD.  This was my first ""Certified Refurbished"" and my impressions are not quite stellar. In the end everything ""works"", the Windows 10 key was legit and the refurbish-er did a pretty good job, so I am mildly happy with the purchase. I would probably buy again because even though I there are shortcomings and I have had to buy replacement parts the price to value ratio is pretty good. If you are not into replacing parts on your laptop when you first receive it you may want to look else where."
1.0,Not worth it.,"I really wanted to be excited about these computers. I know others who have bought them and are really happy with their purchase, but that was not the case for us."
5.0,"Outstanding Deal, Performance and Condition","The unit I received was sold by Blazing Prices, and refurbished by Joysystems. Without hesitation, I can say that this is the best value (and quite possibly best performing) notebook I've owned (a MacBook Air among them). With the SSD, this boots into the Windows 10 sign-on screen in 6 seconds (from power off), and just a few more seconds to a fully ready desktop after login. Cosmetically, though not in brand new condition, it's in extremely good condition. The only places where there are a few minor scratches, are spots you'll never see. Two thumbs up to Joysystems for the refurbishing job, and Blazing Prices for the good deal."
5.0,Possibly the best deal on Amazon,"For the price, this is an awesome deal. My refurbished laptop arrived looking and running like brand new. In fact, It's considerably faster than the $800 laptop it replaced. It's missing a couple of features than would have been nice (side numbers and a webcam) but the webcam is pretty much a luxury anyway, and I have one on another laptop. The reason I bought this was that I had previously bought one for my daughter to start college with, and I was so impressed with that one that I purchased a second one. It's a workhorse of a computer and takes all that I can throw at is as a web developer and graphic designer. In fact, I'm sick that I spent $1250 on a new Toshiba back in January when this one performs just as well. I noticed that some other reviews stated problems with some sellers and units that came in with different specs than advertised. I was lucky in that mine's exactly as advertised. Providing you don't have those problems, I can't recommend this laptop highly enough."
5.0,Incredible Deal and Aesome machine!,"These Latitude E6420's are the beast! Yes, and the best. We have bought 4 of these in two separate purchases and are really happy with their endurance and performance. Two of them we have in conference rooms for various types of large led screen presentations. Another in manufacturing supporting proprietary robust applications and another for CEO remote use. Incredible awesome machines!"
5.0,"Considering they retailed for nearly $1800 new, this is a bargain in a very rugged machine!!","Certainly meets my expectations as a refurbished computer. I would say it is much closer to ""New"". Not a single wear mark on the machine anywhere. Performance is more than adequate, and the solid state hard drive is absolutely a huge win for performance. I will be installing an additional 4GB of ram into mine although it performs perfectly with the 4 already installed."
4.0,Pretty Average Laptop,It's an ok computer. I used it as a temporary machine for work and ended up going back to my Aspire e1-5323-2616 after fixing its keyboard and OS. But the lack of camera is a bit of a downer. I like harassing people on video calls.
5.0,"Solid performer, great feel on features and build","This laptop feels solid, has a nice symmetry to it, the screen size is perfect (not too big, not too small), nicely bright, and great keyboard. The biggest surprise for me was the keyboard, which has a separate numeric keypad area on the right side. Not what I had expected but a nice surprise. Sadly I can't seem to find other laptops of this model and configuration or otherwise I would buy me a second one. Came with Windows 10  Professional which is the way to go if you're to use Windows at all. Like my previous Dell E6410, this one has a secure future as a Linux Mint laptop."
2.0,"""Certified"" Refurbished","Based on the condition of this laptop, being certified means nothing. The case was chipped and deeply scratched. Above the latch is cracked so that it is difficult to open. It was missing a screw,  one of the 4 that secures the hdd. This is just plain used and in poor shape for used. Certified refurbished must mean hard drive reimaged and laptop thrown into box without a second look."
5.0,Must have for any budget DYI-er,"**Disclaimer: I ordered and paid for a Dell Latitude E6420, but the seller sent me an E6430. So, for clarification purposes I'm writing this review under the direct page I bought from except for an E6430.**"
5.0,Outstanding product and support!,"Right off the bat let me say I am extremely satisfied. Initially when trying to decide whether not to buy a refurbished laptop I had some concerns after reading the reviews. That being said  The majority were positive. This laptop has a solid-state core, I-7processor and is lightning quick. There were two or three minor concerns. Two of the keys were stiff but my personal tech guy said he could fix it for 25 bucks brand-new keyboard. The one other thing was I don't get sound through the laptop. I can plug-in ear buds and here's that way but was also told that this should be a very simple fix as well.  The laptop was delivered as promised very quickly, I believe within three days if my memory serves. Also I was pleasantly surprised that when I had a question I called the seller and got through immediately and he answered all my questions. So for what it is A refurbished Dell this for me was a great deal"
1.0,SSD Died...Do Not Buy....No Product Support,"SSD was of poor quality and died in 3 months.  Wife is a teacher, and lost all of her work....do not buy....ever"
5.0,Working fine after two years,"I am a bargain shopper.  For example, I have always bought used cars.  I bought this computer planning to use it as my home computer and assume I will want to replace it after maybe two years--I don't want to get too far behind in technology."
1.0,Worked for less than one month and now I have ...,Worked for less than one month and now I have been working with Dell for 2 months without any resolution. I have spent hours on the phone and my sons laptop not working
5.0,Received exactly what I wanted!,"I was lucky to be one of the customers to get a great refurbished laptop with everything promised in the description. It even came with the Dell factory-made AC Adapter. So, I basically only needed this for small business work, internet, and very minimal gaming. The screen size doesn't bother me because I have it duplicated to my 48"" Samsung LED.  I always have the laptop plugged in so the battery hasn't been an issue. There was plenty USB ports, but I do plan on getting a 4-port hub. Since I have this duplicated to my TV, the laptop is closed and the brushed-metal lid just gives off a sleek look. This is a pretty basic review but hope it helps!"
2.0,Don't buy refurb.,"Lesson learned:  Never buy refurb. This is the 2nd time I tried out an Amazon refurbished computer, and it is (almost) as terrible as the last one.  It came with a ridiculously cheap power block that is making noise (that isn't supposed to happen) and the screen wobbles.  Literally, it looks like its going to fall off if I shake it.  It's honestly a shame, because it clearly used to be a great computer."
5.0,Good value,Happy with it. Screen and keyboard look like new. The outside shows very minimal use. The battery will only charge to 87% but that still gives me over 4hrs of use. New higher capacity batteries on Amazon are less than $40.00. Came with windows 10 and  a new windows license on the bottom of the laptop. Windows Cortina walked me through the setup and I was up an running in less than 10 min including registering Windows.
3.0,My purchase arrived on time and package really good. The computer preforms wickedly fast,My purchase arrived on time and package really good. The computer preforms wickedly fast. Happy about that.
4.0,Shows Dell can build good machine when it puts its mind to it,"Shows Dell can build good machine when it puts its mind to it.  Think it cost $2,000 a few years ago. So at $200 it's a great value. Of course, at five pounds, it's no lightweight."
5.0,"Great price, excellent condition,and very quick delivery",Just what I needed to run diagnostic program for a boat motor. I placed my order on 3 April and received it 1pm on 5 April.
1.0,Not good,"Does not resume from suspend, not good even Dell cant fix and is out of manufacturers warranty."
1.0,The laptop was great when it was working but unfortunately after having it ...,The laptop was great when it was working but unfortunately after having it for about 4 months I was using it and the screen flickered and turned off but the laptop is still functional. Im not sure if its an issue with these dell latitudes but 4 months was not long enough for the price. Could just be a weird defect on mine but if anybody else has dieing on them be warned
5.0,Five stars...super value!!!,Excellent computer and customer service follow up email. The computer is flawless and is super fast! Would definitely buy from this seller (Microbee) again!!! AAAA++++!!
3.0,"Battery already close to to gone, already need to ...","Battery already close to to gone, already need to buy a new battery straight out of the box. Warning to replace comes up on login. It only holds a charge for 45 minutes."
4.0,Mine has a dead pixel and minor scuffing...,"Mine arrived quickly and well packaged. I was disappointed to find a dead pixel in the lower left corner, about 2"" from either side (so very in the way)."
4.0,Four Stars,"Great for the price, runs great, dvd player works, has an okay speaker, overal good little laptop."
2.0,"Item arrived DOA. Even when pugged into wall, ...","Item arrived DOA.  Even when plugged into wall, doesn't do anything.  When I press the power button, the fan whirls for a moment, and then nothing.  After visiting the Dell web site, I determined that it was the RAM.  Long story short, one RAM slot is defective.  And the other works with a module of no more than 4GB.  So, upgraded the RAM, replaced the hard drive to one a bit bigger, installed a back- llit keyboard, and upgraded the WIFI to AC, and now it works pretty well for what I use if for."
4.0,Excellent,This meets my expectations fully.  In spite of being used/refurbished from the standpoint of appearance or function there is no way I could distinguish it from a brand new one.  I am very well pleased.
1.0,SOUND QUIT WORKING,"I bought this for my grandson for his homework and classes (he does online classes). The sound quit working. I did get authorization to return, had to pay $42 for return to the seller. This is an archaic  machine, and it weighs a lot. I won’t buy computers off amazon again"
3.0,"Great PC, Great Price, Malfunctioning Charger","The PC works well, and the laptop itself is in good condition. However, the charger that was sent out with my laptop did not function at all. A replacement for the charger cost me ~$25, and 2 days of a dead new laptop while the new charger is shipping. This has been an inconvenient lack of quality assurance."
5.0,So far so good,First day but seems very good
5.0,Great laptop,Perfect size and speed laptop
5.0,Five Stars,Great computer and even better customer service.
5.0,Nice Unit,"Nice unit, perfect for what I wanted to use it for. Like new and great price in my estimation."
3.0,Not for the price,"Bought refurbished. Its ok. I have issues with the keypad. I will be typing and out of nowhere it will stop typing and jump back to a different part of a sentence and finish typing there. Very annoying. Also can be very slow typing. Sometimes will stop working while Im typing and not add the letters I've typed but start back up missing them if that makes sense. For instance ill try and type ""Thank you have a great day"" and ill get ""thank you e a gr dy"". It is very heavy, I don't like the touch pad feature and I thought this model came with a ten key since it was a business model but it does not which is a huge inconvenience for me. Also does not hold a charge well. Ive been on it for a couple hours and my battery is almost done. But it does ok other than that. After I bought this and thought I got a deal, my husband went to best buy and got a brand new laptop flex touch screen for the close to the same price I paid for this. I would definitely shop around (not on amazon) and look at getting something new instead for maybe only $50-100 more if that."
4.0,... was packed very well started it and it works great. We'll worth the money and I would buy ...,I took the unit out of the box that was packed very well started it and it works great.
4.0,Not bad,Computer itself is fine. But they must have used some cheap aftermarket battery. This will barely hold a charge for more then 45 min
2.0,High power consumption device,The power  consumptions of the  device  too high all the time  hot air come out from the laptop.
1.0,573,This laptop would not stay on. It was fully charged but wouldn't stay on.  This was a bad purchase.... I will never purchase a refurbished laptop again.
1.0,Crap,I bought 2 of these laptops as Christmas presents.  Both had issues including the replacement of 1 of them.  That means 3 had defects.  I will never attempt to buy refirbished again.
4.0,"No problems, great purchase.","Beat my expectations for a refurb. Without close very examination you would think it was brand new.  No problems with speed and performance, i feel i got more than what i paid for which is how any consumer loves to feel."

5.0,Five Stars,as advertised
5.0,Great battery life,"Great battery life, well built, robust, fast and efficient. Was able to upgrade to windows 10 at no charge. Plenty of USB ports and it even had an HDMI port. The only comment was the prior user's perfume permeated the unit and is slowly going away. I'm always pleased with Dell. It had all I need at this time!"
5.0,Unit arrived super clean and is extremely fast,I was a little leery about buying a refurbished computer.  I would say not to have any qualms about buying from this seller.  Unit arrived super clean and is extremely fast.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  Going to buy another one for my wife.

I then upgraded the ram to 16gb though it said in specs it only was upgradable to 8gb... That is just the most ram that dell had tested in it when it was new.  16 worked fantastically... It is ungodly fast now!
5.0,Laptop and numbers.,No problems with using this laptop. It is fast but you need to become comfortable with typing the numbers from the top rather than the side.

4.0,"Very nice, lightweight laptop that is efficient and have good ...","Very nice, lightweight laptop that is efficient and have good RAM speed.  I bought this laptop as a refurbished laptop and the only issue I have had with it is the mouse pad which tends to glitch whenever I have the laptop plugged in to the power cord.  The other downfall is the laptop comes with no installed anti-virus program and is prone to pick up a malware virus due to the loaded applications on the laptop that allows pop-ups from all sort of sites.  First thing you have to do after registering the pc, is to download a malware anti-virus software.  Other than that, pc is great."

1.0,"Intermittent can't be fixed by refurbishing.....if it ""Ain't"" failing when they plug it in....they can't fix it.","Product was refurbished.  Worked fine for 4 months.  Now every command says ""Bad Request.""  Can't  use it.  It only had a 3 month warranty.  Evidently it had a problem that required it to be refurbished.  They did not fix the problem.  I learned a lesson.  It does not pay to ""GET CHEAP"" when buying computers.  Buy it new, from a dependable company and get the full warranty."
4.0,Allow Time,"Allow time for a re-install of the Operating System!  The product code provided for this refurbished machine required a complete re-install which took about 90 minutes. Once that was done, all has been good. I found the docking station that works with this on Amazon, too."
1.0,Hard Drive Crashed 12 hours After Delivery,The Laptop's hard drive crashed after 12 hours. This was a disappointment and and an inconvenience. The laptop was supposed to serve as a work laptop the following week.
1.0,Very Expensive Paperweight.,"This product was sold as ""Dell  refurbished certified""; from the minute I started using the computer it started acting funny.

4.0,Have the latest service pack before registering Windows,"I had difficulty validating my copy of Windows and discovered (by accident) it was because the computer didn't have the latest service pack installed. It would have been nice to know about that before I started. As for the computer itself, it is fast enough for what I use it for, but I'm disappointed with the battery life. I was hoping for a 9 cell, but I do not recall the ad stating which battery it came with, so I cannot claim that it was misadvertised. I was attracted to this model because of the SSD, Windows 7 pro, the solid build and the eye catching price."

4.0,I like the product,"I rated this product 4 stars due to it missing a screw on the bottom of the case. It also came with a cheap charger which requires a little longer to charge the battery. Overall, I like the product. It's a tad bit on the slow side, however, gets the job done."

This laptop was found to have a problem with the plastic frame around around the  screen ,it kept coming loose,also the bottom plastic had to be snapped into place several times. Also this was not a new item,it was refurbished and was not checked out before shipping, plus packing was very skimpy. Be aware that the battery tends to get hot after use and the bottom side gets hot."
1.0,You don't always get what you pay for...,I love my laptop but my only gripe is that it was furnished with an old battery that has a power supply of less than an hour when fully charged. This resulted in me having to purchase a new battery for my laptop which is why I'm only giving one star. I don't think that it's not too much to expect that a new laptop to have a new and fully functioning battery that actually works!😒
