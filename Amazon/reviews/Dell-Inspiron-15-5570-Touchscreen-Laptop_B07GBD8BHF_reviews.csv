4.0,overall pretty good (from someone who is only familiar with using a mac),"I'm not tech savvy, my bf actually recommended this to me. Overall its a pretty good laptop. I had to purchase it for a class I'm taking that requires the applications the laptop has to offer. I primarily use a mac book pro (early 2015) so I'm not used to the dimmer lighting of the screen of this laptop even at its full brightness. the track pad needs a little more pressure if you're right clicking or left clicking, i've had friends who borrow it, who use pc's who aren't used to having to ""press so hard"" (as they put it) and have gotten a bit frustrated"
