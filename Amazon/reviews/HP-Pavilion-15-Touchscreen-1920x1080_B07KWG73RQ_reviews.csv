5.0,Very good business laptop for the price,I am very happy with the purchase of this HP Pavilion laptop with 8th generation Intel Core i5 processor.
1.0,Error code first time turned on,"I spent several weeks looking for a replacement for an older laptop. Finally picked this one. Took it out of box, plugged it in, turned it on, and was greeted with a black screen and an error code telling me that fan was not working."
5.0,Generally Great,"I use it basically to do school stuff, writing, run Netflix, Facebook, Skype or other random apps, it works great and fast so far. I love it specially for Skype conversations, it’s a great computer. I’ve had it just for 2 days lol but love it so far."
5.0,GREAT CHEAP COMPUTER,"This is a very good computer for what I need, which is mostly business purposes and document storage.  It is fast and easy."
4.0,Not newest i5 Coffee Lake - But is upgraded Kaby Lake -U/Y,"So far so good, faster than my 2nd Gen i7 laptop, and with a touchscreen to boot... I added a Samsung 860 EVO 500GB M.2 SATA SSD, it is recognized but I need to finish removing the old HDD so the SSD comes online as the boot drive (it won't allow the cloned drives to be online at the same time). Also, I am about to install a 2nd 8gb memory SODIMM because only one is in use. Once all is said and done I'll update my review, but it is definitely worth the money so far. (under $500) Plus $48 for memory, and $97 for the SSD."
5.0,Was a Christmas Gift,The receiver of this laptop said it was amazing and he loved it.  He has now in Afghanistan and has it with him. Hoping he stays safe.
2.0,Horrible webcam.,"I teach online and while I have an extremely webcam, I still need a laptop with a decent webcam for when I travel and don’t want too many accessories to take along. I currently use an Acer and it has an excellent HD webcam. I expected the HP laptop to have one equally good or better. I was shocked to see the poor quality videos and pictures it was producing.  Not sure if this was just defective or this is how it’s supposed to be. Too bad because I liked the look at feel of the laptop. The keyboard was perfect and so was the touch screen. Rest of the specs and price suited me fine."
5.0,Packed with features and lightweight.,"Awesome laptop. Nice footprint, full of features and light weight. Love it love it love it!"
1.0,"Great in theory, horrible in person","I purchased this laptop thinking I was going to make a good investment considering all the reviews and who makes it, it's a touch screen laptop with a terabyte of memory and a decent camera with a really good build design."
1.0,not working properly,"I have been looking for a laptop for grad school. I thought this one would work.  While just browsing the internet the machine shuts off automatically. I thought it was the battery. When I was able to power on the machine, the battery was at 45%. I thought it was just a fluke. Now the machine will not power on with adapter plugged in.  Back to Amazon it will go. The hunt continues for a decent laptop"
5.0,Great laptop for the money!,"I wanted a good resolution laptop for watching movies, one with a fairly large hard drive and one with good response. This one is really good for the price. I couldn't be happier. It puts my older laptops to shame. This one is so much faster and the picture is really good at 1920x1080. Bought one for my wife too!"
1.0,The worst purchase I've made,"5 hours, only 5 hours lasted my new laptop and now the only thing I can watch on the display is ""No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key"". I live in Ecuador, I can't send it back to the US so I'll try to solve this problem here."
5.0,Great Laptop,This laptop is amazing.  I am using it as a second home computer to my desktop so the size is perfect.
5.0,Good computer,"This computer works for me. I use it to access work files remotely and for my personal use, and have no complaints."

5.0,Great,Good
