5.0,This is a great laptop for the price!,This is a good little laptop.
4.0,Great machine for Linux.,"I was hoping that this machine would behave well under Linux, and so far, it has."
5.0,This Little Laptop Is Killer!,"I recently was in the market for a new workbook / laptop, I have owned several high-end Macbooks in the past but was in search of something simply for browsing, streaming and word editing without spending hundreds if not thousands of dollars."
3.0,please read before buying.,do not order this laptop because it has ONLY windows s-mode and there is no way to deactivate this unless you spend more money to purchase and upgrade. I returning this back asap!
5.0,I had to downgrade from my disturbed  15.6,Thought I ordered an 14 inch
5.0,First time user,"My daughter received this as a Christmas present. She needed her own laptop for school work. And she loves it. Easy to surf the web, check her emails and do school assignments. The only thing was that we had difficulty with Microsoft 10 not letting us download  Chrome. It took a lot of time to figure it out.  Other than that it's a great laptop for a first time user."
1.0,Defective,The screen had a big black spot that was the size of a half dollar and looked like it may spread further on to the screen asking to return at your expense for defective item.
5.0,Nice small lightweight computer!,"This is exactly what I was looking for, a nice small lightweight computer to take with me when I want to do some writing outside of my home.  I just got it so I haven't used it too much yet but so far, it works great.  The screen is small but I can use MS Word and change the font size for easier viewing.  It has two USB ports.  The screen has beautiful crisp color.  Great price from HP.  My home computer is an HP, I love their products."
2.0,DEFECTIVE! RETURNING IT. SAD NOW. :.(,"I AM VERY SAD. I have been so excited all week waiting for this computer to arrive. I opened it tonight and was pleased to see that it was very nicely packaged in its original HP box. I charged it up, turned it on, and OH NOOOO THERE IS A BIG DEAD SPOT ON THE SCREEN!! I bought this item for the sole purpose of using it for digital art. I can not use it if there's a big ol' patch of dead pixels in the way. I'm returning it and will buy a different laptop from a different vendor. So disappointing. I do not recommend."
4.0,Good value economy laptop,"Had to return first unit. Space bar would often not register a keystroke. Amazon quickly sent a replacement. Basic computer. Needed something cheap to throw in my backpack or browse online while on the couch and this fit the bill. Wish HP offered a 6gb memory version, 4 is just barely enough to run windows and a few browser tabs. Other than that works great."
1.0,Can not even set up.,Set up not possible. Ask for birth date. Enter it and would not accept  .
2.0,Space bar works terribly,"I just need this for times when I am away from home. I am so terribly disappointed because the space bar works terribly. To send it back would be so much trouble - I expect things like space bars should work just fine, but this is a pain. I have to pound on it to make it work  and it only works if I pound it in the middle.  This means I have to take my hands off and on the keys, resulting in several typos. Don't buy it."
1.0,...,Receieved a laptop with a damaged screen...
4.0,Bang for Buck,"I bought this laptop to use for school work which is about all that I needed it for. The laptop is light making it bearable to carry around for class or to work to be able to type up the paper or do research needed. The internet speed is relevant to other laptops as there isn't delay time and waiting for the browser to load. A nice feature was that it came with Microsoft Office for one year which is helpful to the pocket for those that are using this laptop for that reason. I would recommend using a flash drive or external memory device to store any work that you are saving, unless you are using a cloud option.  Battery life is relatively good as I can use it all day without it being a problem and it charges pretty quick as well. The overall quality for the price of this laptop makes it worth it."
5.0,Bought 3x. Perfect for Microsoft Office and light internet use!,"$160 is all this cost me and it works great for basic productivity applications. With this little guy I'm able to prepare PowerPoint presentations for work, analyze data in Excel, write in Word, smoothly remote to my main workstation via TeamViewer, and browse in Chrome. I'm even able to stream 720p video just fine. I could also run Octave and do some basic image processing (which really surprised me)."
5.0,Very satisfied,"Perfect for taking to class with me, lightweight, easy to set up and comes with Microsoft office free for a year. Very satisfied."
2.0,LOVED until it stopped working,We LOVED this tiny affordable computer until in less than 3 months it stopped connecting to the internet for no reason.  Working with customer service is very hard.  They talked me in to a payment plan that cost more than the computer (but gives service to ALL my computers for 1 year).  Then when I got thru to them (after many hours of round and round) it was determined it couldn't be fixed and we had to send the computer back to HP to be replaced.  We haven't gotten them replacement computer back yet.  (VERY happy they agreed to replace it!!! )
1.0,Returned,Froze twice within first six hours of use. Spent an hour on the phone with HP both times. Back in the box for return.
1.0,Useless!,"Couldn’t even get this to run. Correction, it ran through the set up but I wasn’t able to use the Internet. I could search on google but couldn’t access any websites. Possibly because of windows 10. Not sure. Yes, I shut everything down and rebooted. All my other devices were able to connect to WiFi.  HP support was AWFUL! They kept telling me nothing was wrong with the laptop.  I told them couldn’t get online to turbo tax and rep at HP said “well I am able to get on the website so you should be able to get on the website.” Dumbest thing I ever heard, he’s on an entirely different computer. Needless to say, after 90 minutes on the phone with HP, they were not able to solve the issue or getting the laptop to work so I returned it. Very frustrating experience. Amazon allowed me to return with no hassle. In fact, UPS came to my door with the return label."
4.0,Small but mighty,"As of now this laptop does it job to browse the internet, check emails, and do a little shopping online lol"
3.0,NO Office 365 Included,"The laptop was sent out to me within two days of ordering it. It came neatly packaged in all original HP packaging. What really annoyed me is that they advertised that a 1-year free personal subscription to Office 365 is included and when I set-up the product I noticed that it is not pre-loaded. I contacted the seller and they let me know I had to register the product with the manufacturer, and they would send me an activation code. I registered my product and had a two-hour remote-controlled service on my PC with and HP representative; he then let me know that the subscription is not included in the normal sale of the product. Long story short, I do not have access to Office 365, false advertising and very frustrating. Two hours wasted on trying to get something that wasn't included in the first place. Very upset with this."
5.0,So far wonderful!,"Most important thing: this is the most cooperative keyboard that I have ever used and I have used computers since the 1980's. Typing on this is wonderful. Setup was a little difficult because I already had a Microsoft Office subscription on my other two computers, so I had choices to make. Setting up Outlook with our e-mail required the help of the tech at our internet server. All in all, this did not take too much time. We purchased this computer to use when we travel, but I am finding it very enjoyable right now, sitting at my kitchen table. For the price this was an excellent purchase for us."
5.0,Powerful Little Guy! You will LOVE this little laptop.,"I thought I was buying a real cheapo little computer. This thing is doing so well, I have moved my mobile business ops into it! Add a big (low profile) 3.1 USB drive to it and you have a little monster. Love how fast it powers up. I have a large custom built Acer, and this little guy blows the startup time in the dust! This little thing has been able to do everything I need or want it to, short of gaming (did not buy it for ANY games). REALLY glad I did my homework on this one."
1.0,Wireless card wont work,We ordered this laptop and it worked fine. After having it exactly 30 days we tried to contact something wirelessly and it wouldn’t connect. The wireless card is out or something. However we can not return it because it is the 16ths and the cut off was the 12th. But its like how do you know that’s out until you try and use it.! very disappointed.
5.0,"Not A Bad Little Puppy, This!",Look ....
5.0,"Great little laptop, windows S not an issue!","I'm writing this review from this very laptop I've had for all of 2 hours. First and foremost, I already have firefox downloaded and the S mode disabled. Took like 10 minutes. Went to mozilla, tried to download, then a popup asked me if I wanted to disable S mode for free. Select yes, let it do its thing and now I have regular windows 10. Peasy."
1.0,Bad,Slow computer...when connected to a internet connection this computer leads everything so slowly i feel like I'm using dial up internet. I should've spent more money for better quality tech.
1.0,Black Dots,Product came in a nicely packed box and everything was there. Unfortunately the moment I turned it on I was met with this horrid black dot at the bottom of the screen. No thank you. Will be returning and purchasing a different product. Do not buy this one!
1.0,Didn't last long.,"I only had the computer for a month and the screen turned blue, I couldn't get out of it. A few minutes later it died. I had only used it about 5 times. Luckily Amazon gave me a full refund."
1.0,Cap light blinks...laptop doesn't respond. Black screen.,It worked alright the first day or so and when I went to boot it up the following morning it didn't respond. There was just a blinking light coming from the caps lock. Wasn't expecting alot for $160 but I want it to turn on. Returned for a refund.
5.0,Perfect for travel,"I have a larger dell for music with 10xs the storage as this. I only needed this for work because my dell was too big to haul around. This works perfectly for what I need. It’s lightweight, connects to the internet no problem. I think it’s a good value for the money."
5.0,Perfect for what it is.,"I’ll make it simple, to view email, browse the web, streaming video, this is perfect."
1.0,Not what I expected.,"I like the size but that's all. First, it is programmed to accept only Internet Explorer for its search engine - I am used to Google Chrome and I prefer it. Second, immediately after using it and continuing up to this day, I am bombarded with scam error messages that sometimes tie up my computer. As I said, it is a scam that makes it appear that it has hijacked my computer. I never pay attention to any of it but it is extremely annoying. These two issues alone make my not like this version of the operating system."
5.0,fabulous,i have only had this laptop a couple of days so far i love it. it came in windows 10 s mode i did switch out of it. to do that just google it for instructions. first time start up was a breeze and a program called cortina walks you threw everything. its fast with my 5g wifi it dosn't skip and studder. i bought the new one when you purchase this laptop make sure you are buying the new on not the refubished ones it makes a world of diffrence. if something changes i will update.
5.0,Laptop,Exelente laptop muy buena calidad precio y marca
5.0,My 2nd laptop,"I use this as a second laptop if I need one that's smaller than my 15.6''. It's a nice little thing. Not very much RAM, so keep that in mind, but it's a good internet surfer and word processor. For it's purposes, it's great. Firefox does crash on it quite a bit and it doesn't have too much storage, but it's not meant to be your main laptop, just a travel one that's smaller than the main deal. Use it as such and you'll be fine."
5.0,Seems like a nice product - Battery holds up well.,I bought it to present digital artwork at out local art show.  It did a fine job.
4.0,"Overall, a good little laptop","I needed something inexpensive and quick enough to surf the web and create word documents until I can upgrade to something better later. This little computer is perfect for all that. It arrived in perfect condition, set up was simple, and it was up and running before I knew it. My only complaints about it are: 1) the back of the screen is not a flat surface. It's kind of ridged, which puts a damper on my plans of pasting stickers all over it; the stickers would just peel up. And 2) the track pad for the cursor sucks sometimes. I have to almost put a lot of force behind pressing it to get the cursor to select something. I'm going to be investing in a small wireless mouse soon, so I don't have to worry about it anymore."
1.0,Pick Wisely,Product was purchased for myself and i got this one bcus it came with a 1 year subscription for 360 personal Microsoft & & exactly 31 days my network adaptor was fried (you NEED this to connect to internet... So much for streaming )😖😩 When I sent it HP for repair as always they erase eveeything. When it was sent back Amazon blamed HP & HP blamed Amazon & no one wants to pay for my 1 year product key because when you purchase and open your computer the computer bypasses the code because its internal and you cant do a back up on a drive because the computer was inoperable once I followed prompts ordered by HP Tech Support which was to identify the problems with the laptop. Its cute. Black. Light weight.
1.0,Didn't work,"This is a lightweight computer and came the same day but the speaker was staticky the first day so I was already debating sending it back. Well I tried to log back on to delete my information that I already put in, it let me put in my user name and password, press enter and the it just went black. It never did anything else. I had to just put it in the box the way it was."
4.0,"A good value, but a better value if you put linux on it","As is, the hardware is a decent value for the price (good battery life and keyboard, decent build quality, acceptable screen and trackpad) but it's a shame that it is saddled with Windows 10 and mandatory updates that use up the limited storage."
4.0,"Very happy, and Windows S mode removes for free","I was mostly worried about windows S-mode preventing me from using software. No issue at all removing it for free and using windows home. It really is just a setting. All else works as expected, quick to boot. i suggest the CasBuy silicone keyboard cover, ASIN B01FLXT9DE. Fits perfect and keeps it clean even with those snacking kids using it."
5.0,Great travel mini-laptop.,"This small laptop is perfect for those traveling on vacation and doesn't want to carry their larger laptop.  While not really designed for heavy duty work it's light weight makes it perfect for traveling.  It comes with 12 months of Office which is nice but don't expect to save many files on the hard drive.  It is designed to be a ""cloud"" computer."
5.0,Good for the price.,I was expecting a larger screen but that’s my bad. The laptop works great. I’m in online school and it works great for that. The battery life is great. I don’t charge it every night and it’s still got a full battery. I do shut it down when not in use though. It’s extremely light and fits in my purse which is a plus. Great value for the money I spent.
5.0,Great value for the money,"It’s a nice little laptop for the money. I am very happy with it. It boots fast and streams well. First one came with screen defects, but amazon took care of it. Satisfied customer"
5.0,Great deal for price,This is pretty nice for the price. I did install reg windows 10. It is light enough and small enough to fit in my large purse for work as I travel from place to place.  So far it does what I need it to and love it comes with a year of office.  I liked mine so much my Mom purchased one.
3.0,Bought two. One Defective.,"I purchased two of these computers for work. One worked just fine and I have no complaints. The other had a screwy keyboard. Press Y and get a Z. Press Z, get a Y. And all the uppercase number characters were wrong. Checked to make sure the keyboard was set for United States English and everything was correct there. I was on hold with HP support for over an hour. Then the jerks picked up and hung up on me. Sending the one back for full replacement. Thank God I bought this from Amazon. No hassle and fast replacement."
5.0,Great Basic Laptop for School,"It's a great little computer. I use it for school. It's fast, new and was ready right out of the box. It's not a touch screen and it doesn't convert to a tablet. I haven't needed to add any external storage. So there's enough memory for my pix and papers. It's a basic laptop. It's just what I need."
2.0,Resolution is terrible,"The biggest con is the resolution, it’s the worst I’ve ever seen."
5.0,Great,"It’s not touch screen, but it’s a great lightweight laptop to take on the go or for whatever"
1.0,Slow,"Can’t even browse the internet, way too much lag."
5.0,Ease of use.,I liked the ease of setting it up and using the computer itself. I’m mainly using it for email and online searching or buying. Love this laptop.
5.0,Very easy to take computer out of win 10 s mode!,"I have both a Chromebook and a Kindle, wanted something between those, and this is perfect--- it let me turn my regular Windows 10 laptop  ( a little too large for my liking) over to my husband, whose laptop on the way out."
5.0,Really cool!,"Okay, I wasn’t a fan of the s-mode concept. But switching to regular Windows 10 Home was as easy as clicking a button. Nothing had to be installed."
2.0,Bad storage choice,The laptop itself works how it should. Although bad choice in storage capacity. One you have windows fully updated and other softwear that comes with it. There is no storage space left. You either need external storage or buy a different laptop.
5.0,Good to buy,"I don't know if mine is touch screen ... But it's a great little laptop and the cost of it couldn't have been better. There is like no memory to it so I had to buy 2T box to go with it, that was  like $60. Overall I feel like it was a good buy."
5.0,Best Tiny Cheap Laptop Available!,If you're going for the smallest/cheapest laptop....this one is probably the best.  We have one and love it!! Notice the processor is 2x as powerful as other laptops this size & price.  We are so glad we got this one!!!
5.0,Excelente Laptop,"El rendimiento del producto es Excelente, la batería dura muchísimo, es una laptop super ligera ideal para viajar  y 32gb que quizás sean pocos pero con una tarjeta SD extra puedes complementar el almacenamiento ¡Recomendada!"
5.0,Size small and lightweight,I love this laptop. I been buying laptops from Dell very expensive I'm enjoying it. I trying to buy another one but it's not available I guess I'm bless to buy it on time
5.0,Light and easy to carry,"Really cute ❤️ In love with the laptop, light and easy to carry to school, or wherever you want; bought this cause of the size really good quality, the memory is not a lot but in my case I use online things like one drive so not really a problem for me and with that said 5 out of 5 star!!"
5.0,Cost effective & Great Quality Laptop,"I needed something simple and cost effective to work on my resume,  job search,  network, and answer/send emails.  I am so pleased with this laptop and it isn’t too small,  perfect!"
5.0,👍,"I brought 2 but my LO doesnt like it to play games on. Either way it serves it's purpose for the functionality; compact, battery🔋awesome and screen is bright. Still it something to get use to when you have used touch screen forever😂"
5.0,Nice easy lightweight,Love this laptop. Use everyday travel computer
1.0,Bad Sound Card,"The sound when plugged in to a headphone or speaker is beyond ridiculous, dont know if it was defective but simply not acceptable for a 2018/19 product"
2.0,Black defect spot on screen,"It seems like a decent computer. I received it Friday and set it up on Saturday. I used it for a couple hours on Saturday and then haven’t used it since today. When I opened it up, there was this black defect on the screen (wasn’t there when I set it up on Saturday). I read in the reviews that some people have experienced this. Very disappointed."
1.0,it doesn't work as it should do,it doesn't work as it is described
1.0,No WiFi connections,Terrible can’t connect to WiFi
4.0,I consider myself a little computer savy and I cant access Microsoft Office.,I consider myself a little computer savy and I cant access Microsoft Office. It is asking for a product key I never received.

1.0,The screen is damaged,"I recently bought this computer for my younger sister and had it shipped to her in Japan, when she opened it she recognized that the screen is damaged, but the boxes are not damaged. I need to return it ASAP.. So I am using the call me option and it is not working. I need a replacement."
5.0,Great little laptop,"Super light weight. Easy to travel with. Long battery life. Easy navigation. Fast. Works great. Fantastic value, especially for price!"
5.0,Great little laptop,I'm very pleased with this laptop.  It's the perfect size for what I needed. I didn't want anything too big.  It's light to carry. The price was right too!
5.0,Okay I guess,Not a touch screen and screen is not all that there’s a glare and seems so kind of funny looking but overall for the price it’s what you pay for
5.0,Good basic computer,It has a smaller screen than I am used to but it was for my husband so it is just perfect. Easy to set up but we need a good case for him to put into when he is not using it. Otherwise it is a good solid computer. I like HP the best.
1.0,Stops working after a month of use.,Do NOT buy!!!!! I only used this computer three times a month and it had already stopped working. Nothing will load after the first page is opened in the browser. Can not even click on a link. Computer was keptin case when not in use.
5.0,Good value,"Works great, runs fast for the price."

4.0,Fair for the price.,No complaints here.  What you get here is a decent machine for the price.
5.0,Great for school work!,I bought this product to be able to do school work whether I am on break at work or sitting outside in the backyard watching my daughter play. It does exactly what I need it to do. I dont think it would be great for gaming or anything extensive but if you need a lightweight laptop to connect to wifi to do school work it works perfectly!
3.0,Being able to establish all the benefits included.,"When I first signed in, there was a mix up in the initial start up requesting an unknown address. I had to clear up the problem by calling HP support. Now I am unable to sign in to the network and Office 365. The instructions included are incomplete. If I cannot resolve the present problems of signing in I am ready to return the laptop."

1.0,...,My computer isn’t turning on. I was checking an email and it turned off. I went to plug it in because I thought it was dead and nothing happened I googled what could be wrong with it & I found a possible way to troubleshoot it which didn’t work.
