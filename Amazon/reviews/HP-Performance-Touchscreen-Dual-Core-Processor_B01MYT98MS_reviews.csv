5.0,Just great!,"Hello, people! I’m not a big fan of writing reviews but this product is really good. I bought this laptop for my sister, she is a college student. Great computer with touchscreen. Fast, very responsive screen. Great memory capacity and RAM, which is very important for her. And a great price for all this features! I’m very satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,Like the touchscreen,"Like the touchscreen.  Had to disable some stuff.  I really don't want to talk to my computer.  Seems to work great.  Didn't want to pay for Microsoft Office, so I found an Open Office that works well.  Sometimes I pause to look and it responds too well -- if I hover over anything it takes me there even if I just stopped to read something else."
5.0,Make sure you have unlimited Internet data transfer for downloading the Windows OS Upgrades. There are many.,"I gave this laptop five stars, because it is all that I had expected it to be and I like it very much.  HP has made all of the necessary upgrades; so now it works absolutely perfect."
5.0,My Windows updating was very fast,"Great laptop..runs fast and I love the full size keyboard.I will say the windows updating took no time at all for my computer.I noticed some reviewers were complaining it took forever to update.It could be your internet connection possibly,because I don't think it's the computer."
5.0,Amazing laptop!,"This was the first laptop I've ever purchased, and I couldn't have picked a better one. I'm not a gamer, I simply wanted a good laptop for browsing, occasionally watching movies on, and bringing work home when necessary. This one totally fits the bill. I've had the laptop for almost 6 months and have had no problems whatsoever. The touchscreen is perfect and if you'd rather use the keyboard that works great as well. I listen to music and the sound quality is good. I'm able to log into WiFi seamlessly and the Bluetooth feature is great to hook up to my other devices. It's fairly light and easy to carry either in my bag for travel or simply to another room in the house. I've read the other reviews about this laptop not being fast and taking forever for the updates to download but I've never had a problem there either and I'm a rather impatient person. Note:  Even though I know there are other free options out there, I actually paid for Microsoft Office after the free trial ran out as it's worth it for my needs."
5.0,Great Value.,"With the disclaimer that I primarily use my laptop for internet access, this is a great computer for the price.  Much faster speed and a much more ""solid"" feel versus my old laptop of a different brand.  Love the touchscreen. Though there are not a lot of bells and whistles on this model, if you use it for internet access and are not a gamer, I think you will love it.  Great value for the money."
5.0,It runs fast and I would highly recommend this computer for school work,I recently purchased this laptop for school. It runs fast and I would highly recommend this computer for school work
4.0,The computer came on time and in good shape. It started right up and I had ...,The computer came on time and in good shape. It started right up and I had no issues connecting to the internet and getting other functions to perform. The updates that were required only took a few minutes. The only downside is the contrast on the computer screen. It looks washed out and in some cases it is actually difficult to read. It appears to be pretty fast on most functions. All in all though a nice little computer for $450...
4.0,Wifi not connecting (intermittent/ slow)? SOLVED,"I read the reviews about the laptop and saw that many have complained about the wifi being slow or intermittent (or even not working). I had the same problem with this laptop and a similar model. I was able to solve the problem by updating the drivers for the network card. This is located in Device Manager under Network. If you don't know how to do this search Google....I promise there is plenty of info about this there. Other than that problem the computer is ok. It's not the fastest laptop ever, but for the price it's about what you should expect. Hope this helps somebody out there!"
1.0,Apparently people who make laptops think hard drives aren't important,"Bought it to replace an old laptop with hard drive problems. Instead, I get a laptop that turned on for the duration of set-up and then a few minutes after looking online, shuts down due to not having a boot device/hard drive installed. Ironic I bought a new laptop to escape hard drive issues only to have new hard drive issues brought right to my door(To make things worse, I paid extra for 1-day delivery). Thanks but no thanks. Will return immediately."
4.0,Speakers are not loud enough to really enjoy a movie though so external speakers are needed,"Fast, helpful, and not as pricey. Using for my daughters home schooling. Had it for 2 months and we’ve watched movies from dvd and online. Speakers are not loud enough to really enjoy a movie though so external speakers are needed."
5.0,Good buy.,"Good purchase for the money. Bought it as a gift, so I hope it performs as well as I expect it to."
1.0,Poorly made!,"This is a cheaply made computer, and the power cord has died already.  During the first week I had the computer, it would scroll rapidly through every open program and document like a strobe light, and I had to wait until it stopped on its own. Also, some programs recently disappeared,  including Microsoft Office. I will go back to Dell for my next computer."
1.0,Not worth it,"Cheap, flimsy, some keys stopped working with gentle use"
1.0,"The built quality of the laptop is very poor, it has already started to break near the ...","The built quality of the laptop is very poor, it has already started to break near the charging port. Never expected that the HP will make such a flimsy build quality. Highly unsatisfied with the product. I will not recommend this."
1.0,Craptop,This laptop no longer works after minimal use over the course of eighteen months. Huge waste of money. I tried resetting it to fix the problem but it died. I lost tons of files. Now I can’t return it. Don’t waste your money. It’s a scam.
5.0,fast and easy to use,"I'm no geek when it comes to computers, and I needed a laptop to replace the one I'd had for years that had become very slow, non-responsive to some commands, keys falling off, etc etc - love this laptop - easy for me to use, very fast, nice screen quality - the geek who transferred my data over from the old laptop to this one said ""that's a really nice laptop"" -"
1.0,The cake is a lie,"Longtime HP user here, I've only had this product for a few days but it has been overly unresponsive, with a lot of crashes. Lots of these 'problem' boxes have popped up. I'm unsatisfied with my experience so far and will likely send it back for a refund."
5.0,"It works great, does everything it should and is lightweight too","I've been using this laptop for 2 months now and haven't had any problems. It works great, does everything it should and is lightweight too."
5.0,I'm pleased,"Has performed well for me. Touch screen, easy to get up and running on the internet."
3.0,Poor quality materials,The power port and ear bud port are poorly placed and do not make a secure connection.  I see the ports breaking in the  near future.  The plastic shell is also low quality and unpleasant to the touch..  HP is cutting corners on this model
5.0,Number Board great for data entry!,Took a while to download everything.  Once up and running it is working great.  Touch screen feels weird...  The number keyboard is awesome for anyone who has to do data entry.
5.0,So glad to have a touch screen,"Computer came in pristine condition, clearly not a prior return. Set up was easy and the audio assitanant was slightly humerus during the process . Love the touch screen. Have had problems scrolling with mouse after recent updates to windows 7 home and work computers . Problem solved at home with the touch screen."
5.0,Great product for the price,I do trust Amazon for the products they advertise for they do lever always on time this product is awesome touchscreen is wonderful the price is great except for one issue which this computer and laptop doesn’t come with the Microsoft word I have to buy it separate otherwise quality is excellent

5.0,It’s a good laptop for the money,"I bought this for school. It operates as expected. I have had HP machines in the past, including a Pavillion PC which still runs. It’s a great buy for the money."
2.0,Disappointed at battery life,"I JUST got this laptop in August and I am so super disappointed at the battery life. I haven't ever left the battery charging overnight or for long periods of time. However, it still hardly gives me a long battery life. I am so disappointed. I work online and I just can't believe I spent the money on this."
1.0,Slowwww,"Slowwwww. Very frustrating, and I’m only using for web browsing and writing papers."
5.0,Everything is great!,I am a HP laptop user for many years and I have not had a bad HP laptop including this one. Everything is great!
5.0,It does everything My Iwfe would wish it to,"She likes the touch-screen (it is Meh to me..). She likes that is more responsive than her old laptop, she was happy she was able totransfer her old programs over with no issues (including Microsoft Office!)"
