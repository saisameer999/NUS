5.0,LOve the SSD,"Great Laptop for the price point. It says touchscreen but I have never used that, I like my screen to be clean and touching a screen is just plain wrong (you probably told your kids to stop touching the tv screen."
5.0,I LOVE IT...,"Nice laptop...  It's fast and the keyboard is nice.  The touchscreen is a nice addition.  I had a cheaper HP, it was junk.  You get what you pay for.  This laptop should get me through school and then some.  I am pleased with my purchase."
5.0,"Fast, sleek, great laptop for the price","Very impressed with this laptop, especially for the price.  Big screen with great color and clarity.  It boots up fast and I really like the keyboard which is also large and has a calculator/number pad on the side like a remote keyboard has.  The only thing slightly negative is that the buttons on the trackpad are a little ""stiff"" but I use a remote/wireless mouse anyway so that's really not an issue for me.  Overall, I'm really happy with this laptop."
5.0,LOVE THIS THING,"First one i got had a glitchy screen.  I had no issues when i called customer service.  They refunded me the money, I bought a new one, returned the glitchy one with a label they paid for, it was awesome!  And the product is sooooo worth the price!"
5.0,Great buy and great seller,Love love this laptop came brand new still in box and a freat company to but from the touch screen works perfect
5.0,lightweight but still big enough to do all my major projects on.,"This computer is light, compact, and has a touch screen for a pretty good price. I certainly recommend it!"
5.0,HP has been very reliable with computers.  I like having a numeric keyboard & cd/dvd drive.,"I got this as my first touchscreen.  While I think it is awkward to use the touchscreen, reaching over the keyboard, it is helpful on some sites.  I like that HP puts a numeric keyboard on most of their computers, and this also includes a cd/dvd drive.  I rarely use it without plugging it in, so I can't comment on battery life.  The touchpad doesn't always seem real responsive, but touch will work when that doesn't.  I would like to add that I did communicate with this seller about questions, and he was always very pleasant and responsive to my needs.  The 3rd party seller was craving savings."
4.0,Nice laptop,Still trying to learn Windows 10 but i love the touch screen!

3.0,"Will not allow you to load your own version of Word, especially Word 2010","I am an author. Was going to use this for writing while away from home. But refuse to pay $99 rent on Word, a program I already own."
