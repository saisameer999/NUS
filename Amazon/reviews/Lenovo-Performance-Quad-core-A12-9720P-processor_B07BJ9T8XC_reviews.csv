3.0,$ Of the Ram Is soldered in,"I did not like the Ram soldered in - you cannot go above 8 and get true duel channel performance - For it's spec's, I thought it would be faster - Also, The OS was not installed properly. I spent 30 years in computers and could have done a re-install but after paying what I did, I sent it back rather then fixing it myself. The Product specs do NOT list the Model #. A decent machine but even at that price point, It should have preformed better. I would not buy this machine again or recommend it."
5.0,A lot of bang for your buck,"If you're looking for a budget laptop that doesn't demand that you make substantial compromises because of the price point, this is it."
5.0,Best Bang For Your Buck,"After reading some negative reviews I was a bit reserved about getting this laptop. I decided to go ahead and give it a chance because it was a great price considering the specifications, and Amazon is usually pretty good about taking care of returns and refunds if the product is bad. If you are looking for a good laptop to handle day to day tasks like surfing the web, watching YouTube videos, Facebook, Email, etc. this laptop will definitely handle all that with ease. It had no problems rendering video for some of my work projects, and it seems to handle casual gaming pretty well. The screen graphics are not the best, but at this price point it is not a deal breaker. It isn't a touch screen laptop, but for me I honestly don't care about that anyway. It runs slow when you first start it up but after you download the initial updates for Windows 10, it runs just fine. It comes without any bloatware which is great. I personally recommend installing Malwarebytes and getting rid of the McAfee Anti-virus that comes preinstalled because McAfee uses more system resources, and I have experienced good results using Malwarebytes. All in all if you are looking for a good quality laptop at a decent price, then this is the best bang for your buck."
1.0,Keeps freezing. Had to return.,"I purchased this strictly for work, to replace my 2011 MacBook Pro. With a time crunch and a budget, it seemed to meet all the specifications. Zero personal use on the computer. Within 1 week, by my 4th shift, the laptop will completely freeze. Mouse pad frozen, Bluetooth mouse unresponsive, keyboard unresponsive. It has frozen 4 times on me today in a matter of 7 hours. Completely unreliable! Work is making me return and I agree with their decision completely. My early 2011 MacBook Pro lasted me 7.5 years, and this laptop did not last me 7 days."
1.0,Stopped working after 3 days,"It stopped working after 3 days.  When I say stopped working, it would turn on, but the start button on the keyboard and clicking from the trackpad would not work.  Task manager could not be opened. Amazon handled the return quickly and professionally."
5.0,Great laptop,I can do everything from lite gaming to binging movies to doing work from working from home with ease.
5.0,Excellent value for the money spent!,"Have some clients who wanted me to come to them for income tax preparation and consulting - hard to do that without a laptop computer, so I purchased a very nice laptop computer.  With just a few clients, this laptop will be paid for several times over.  Plus its very nice - fast, easy to use - probably the only real issue I have is ....needs to have Win 10 Pro installed, then all will be right with the world of tax again!"
5.0,Good inexpensive Laptop.,"Does what we want it to.. Not too sure about Windows 10... Too much ""Stuff""... Windows 7 Pro much Better OS.."
3.0,Does what I bought it for but.................,"I purchased this laptop the middle of March, my older HP is running 8.1 and I normally replace them every so often just to have a back up. This review isn't so much based on the laptop but the OS. I hate windows 10 hate hate hate hate hate it. The levono is nothing special did what I needed it to do. I don't game, just browse watch videos, netflix, banking, etc. the resolution isn't good on this but, I have an external monitor, so that wasn't an issue."
1.0,Cracked screen,For $345 I got a laptop with cracked screen. Very disappointed! I was waiting for my laptop to start working now I have to wait much longer. Shameful!!
2.0,Screen quality was almost blurry,"I thought maybe my eyes were getting bad, but when I compared the quality of the screen to older laptops in the house, I realized that the resolution/clarity of this new laptop was just plain awful, even after adjusting brightness. I returned the laptop."
4.0,The charger gets really hot.,So far so good. I only need laptop for writing and Netflix. The only thing I don't like is the charger gets really hot when plugged in. I can't leave it overnight
1.0,Returned,"Immediately after set up, numerous problems were encountered.  Laptop failed to maintain a WiFi connection and required reconnecting very 3-5 minutes.  My other home devices (iPhone, Fire tablets)  rarely  have this problem.  Also the device was  very slow when opening desktop programs such as Office 365.  The mouse worked erratically despite adjusting its speed and sensitivity. Also, the zoom function would spontaneously enlarge or diminish the screen size.  I would refer potential buyers  to another recent 1 star review by someone who repairs computers and  reported that  Lenovo components are inferior to those of other brands (Asus and Dell)."
1.0,Piece of crap,"I bought this laptop because my Asus laptop was 14 years old. This obviously was a mistake on my part because this Lenova laptop is not even close to my 14 year old Asus. I have never seen anything like it. It's dead slow, takes forever to boot up. It is intrusive with pop up ads before even connecting it to wifi. It has nothing for software."
4.0,Great Budget Laptop,"Great laptop. The 1TB hard drive is, out of the box, slow as molasses, until you've run your updates (!!)."
2.0,I returned it within two weeks,"I was really excited to get my new laptop....unfortunately, from the get go it was not good. Freezing up on me multiple times a day from day 1. I finally gave up and returned it. There was no point keeping something that did not work properly and I was not about to spend money to find out what the issue was on something brand new."
1.0,DOA,"I was really looking forward to receiving this laptop...great price, all the features I wanted. Got it, plugged it in, turned it on...BSOD! Called Lenovo and they were quite helpful but said it sounded like a corrupt hard drive. Called Amazon and they quickly refunded my money and sent me a return label. Now, do I take my chances and reorder the same one? Maybe just a fluke?"
4.0,Decent Laptop For The Price,"I replaced the standard mechanical hard drive with an ssd. This computer is so much faster with the ssd installed. I purchased this laptop to read work emails, use office, and watch netflix on the go. For these uses i think this computer works great. This laptop doesn't have the best screen either but it gets the job done. If you keep your expectations realistic, this machine is decent for the cost."
5.0,Would recommend,For the price I could not ask for a better laptop. I had purchased an HP Stream prior because it was cheap and it was such a waste. This one works flawlessly and is not as slow.
5.0,"Capacidad, velocidad y precio",Me encantó súper buena
5.0,Nice looking laptop,I have it setup but have not done a lot with it.  It seems to have reasonable computing power and downloaded a 2.7 g file quicker than my MacBook Pro did.  Feels good when working with the keyboard and wireless mouse.  Screen looks great.
5.0,GTEAT VALUE!!! WOW!,Shipped quickly. Packaged well. Works well for what we use it for. Got it so my 8 year old son could practice typing...and play Minecraft. Works very well. Lots of space!! Thin design. GREAT VALUE! Wish I would've seen these before I spent $1k on an Asus.
1.0,Just please.. don't buy,Not a good laptop guys.. the reviews are skewed but let me tell you the first problems you will encounter.
5.0,Switched from Apple to this laptop,"My MacBook Pro died from a motherboard problem. It lasted maybe 4 years, and not wanting to spend that kind of money on a new Mac, I decided on this laptop. Hasn't been a problem switching from IOS to Windows, I used to hate Windows with a passion. Apple has just got to expensive for what you get and this laptop bridged the gap just fine."
5.0,Best bang for the buck!,"Awesome computer. Best bang for the buck. 8GB of RAM, 1TB of HHD, good battery quality."
5.0,Too New!,Can't rate it yet for battery because I haven't had it long enough and besides I bought it for my wife. She seems happy with it and I thought the price was good but she said I spent too miuch money. It was self defense as I was constantly having to work with her old one and it was slow at best.
5.0,Great home/office laptop,"This is a great laptop for home/office users for sure. I know because that’s pretty much how I use it and it’s just great for that purpose. Sorry gaming community if y’all came here to see me tell you if this was the perfect Fortnight laptop. I don’t know, I’m not a gamer. Again, I’m sorry, don’t come for me!"
5.0,Can't be beat in this price range,"After removing the bloatware that comes with Windows, this laptop is pleasantly fast. If you're trying to play GTA or some huge game, or use AutoCAD, obviously you need another computer, so those reviews talking about this not being usable, either have the wrong computer for what they're doing, or dont know what they're doing. Google removing Windows 10 bloatware, maybe spend an extra $30 on an SSD, if you have some extra money to burn, spend another $40 to upgrade the RAM, and this is a great computer."
1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!! In less than 6 weeks since opening it, it has had frequent freezing, and now had a total windows crash. And they have the worst support hours ever. Wish I had bought my another HP after my last one lasted 8 years."
5.0,oustanding so far for home use,I like the laptop. fast and reliable.
4.0,High level of performance and multitasking but low level of battery life and screen quality.,"If you are looking for a cheap laptop with good performance level for daily internet surfing, MS Office usage, watching youtube your choice will be good. Even you could play some games with high system requirements, for exp. PES 2018 goes really fast."
5.0,Worth the purchase,I purchased this system for writing and it holds up very nicely. I’ve also tested the quality when it comes to videos and even making and editing videos. Not to shabby
5.0,Lenovo is the best,"My first laptop was terrible, Then I bought this and I couldn't be happier. Be smart and just buy Lenovo you'll be glad you did. Plus if you get the help app you will get excellent service and piece of mind..Thank You Lenovo.."
4.0,It can be used for light gaming With low setting,Touchpad froze during first use.. Otherwise it's a great laptop for the price.
4.0,good value for multi-tasking,"Bought this laptop for multi-functioning at home. It has all the bells and whistles for the right amount of money.  The AMD processor works smoothly. I only have 2 issues with this product: it could use an additional USB port, and it comes with a sufficient amount of adware. Otherwise, it is a sound piece of machinery, does everything I want it to without complications."
5.0,Teach your customer service better.,It has been great. Even though customer service at Amazon said it wasn't compatible but it was. I bought a HDMI and it was compatible. She just kept wanting to help me send it back.
2.0,Mouse doesn't work,I purchased this almost one month ago. When it arrived the mouse didn't function all of the time and as of today it doesn't work at all. Also the charging cord is so loose it often falls out. I am going to try to find someone local to try abd fix it. I do like Lenovo products but this one is a dud.
5.0,Good for school etc,"As expected, works great"
2.0,Looking for a good PC laptop? Look further.,"Well, part of my dissatisfaction stems from working on a Windows platform. The voice assistant is irksome, and the trackpad is pretty confounding. It seems to activate without any decisive command to do so. The battery life is quite poor and short. The unit is pretty heavy and cumbersome as well."
1.0,Unfortunate transaction,Did initial set up. Operating system encountered an un-repairable error and wouldn't start the computer anymore.
3.0,Not a bad laptop for the price,"This computer replaced an Acer with less RAM, so I'm pretty satisfied so far. It seems to be holding up with all my multitasking. I thought the keyboard was backlit, so I was disappointed to find out it wasn't. As some others have said, the screen resolution could be better, but oh well. Overall, I think it's a good deal for the price. If you're not ready to spend over $400 for a computer, this is a pretty good one."
2.0,Beware broken laptop,Broken on arrival...
4.0,Hard to beat cost/hardware,"Great for the cost range, good for most activities. Would give it 5 stars yet I have noticed it can't quit handle some of the new game graphics and continuous playback of HD movies. Its advertised good for games but be cautious with expecting it to perform well with new games coming out and future stuff."
5.0,That it lives to my expectations.,"So far I'm very pleased with the unit for the price.  Well designed laptop. attractive, sturdy, and fast responses."
5.0,As Advertised,No surprise on this purchase.  Seller quickly delivered  laptop that met all expectations.

1.0,Product came broken...,"The laptop came in with a dead battery... Won't turn on or stay on for a second if not charging. Even thought it says its battery is at 88%+ when its on, will go off as soon as you unplug the charger."
3.0,Disappointing...,"Maybe I'm too used to SSD now, but I felt really disappointed with the performance of this laptop. It takes forever to boot and even browse the internet!"

4.0,Lenovo laptop,Seems like the battery does not last very long. I think was a good value. If it had been more expensive I would have been more concerned. Lenovo does make dependable products.
