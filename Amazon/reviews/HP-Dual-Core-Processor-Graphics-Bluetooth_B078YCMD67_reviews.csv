5.0,Like previous viewers have said,"Like previous viewers have said, this laptop comes with a lot of bloatware. Right out of the box I did a Windows 10 reset and it was gone. After that, it was a screaming fast machine! It does not come with a word processing program, but Apache OpenOffice (google it) is a free download and it is almost everything that Microsoft Word is. I am not one to be heavily involved with spreadsheets/Excel, so this program was great for me...same interface as Word. For the price, you would be hard pressed to beat this laptop. Just be sure to do the Windows 10 reset (very easy...just takes a  bit of time) before you do anything else or else you will be plagued with preinstalled trials, bloatware, and silly programs."
2.0,Useless out of the box,Useless out of the box. This machine was crippled with HP bloatware/crapware that rendered it unable to function. It wouldn't make it through Windows update out of the box. After using Windows 10 Fresh Start and reinstalling the operating system without the manufacture provided crapware the computer is fine. None of the provided software other than Windows 10 is needed or what you want.
4.0,Good System if you delete bloatware,"For the price, you can't complain.  Just remove the bloat-ware and it is a solid machine."
4.0,Great... but like the others say you have to wipe it to make it functional.,All of the reviews are true both good and bad. The bones of this computer are great but the Windows 10 version and all the extra junk HP loaded on it make it function like a computer from the 90's... with dial up practically.
5.0,A GREAT DEAL,TOP GRADE MERCHANDISE:
4.0,"HP Premium 15.6"" Laptop, 2018","New version, 2018.  This laptop works right out the box.  However, I was not careful beforehand:"
1.0,Pc is very slow out of the box. Not even good for beginners. Barely plays low end games.,"So besides the long wait on shipping the product got here and it turned on no issues. But like everyone else out of the box the cpu usage was at 100%. I reset the whole thing and reinstalled windows and the problem was not cured. I bought it for the cheap price but even cheap should mean useable. If you can afford to spend more and not get this laptop, do it."
1.0,Don't buy HP,"Absolutely ridiculous purchase. Click on Chrome, IE or Firefox-3 pages open and I cannot type in any search bar. Try to read an ebook? Takes minimum of 15 mins to open the book, and then it sits for another 5 or so before you can turn a page. Want to open a word doc? Forget it. I've had this for two weeks so there's nothing to even defrag-I've run multiple virus scans etc. This is not user error. This is a bad product."
1.0,I've spent hours hunting for something I can use on the stripped piece of crap. So I'm returning it,"I bought this thinking I could use it to edit home videos, wrong! I bought this with a r/w dvd burner drive but can't use it without buying an app to use it. I have been using Windows 10 since it came out, it has mover maker, dvd player, basic word etc. this one has nothing. I've spent hours hunting for something I can use on the stripped piece of crap. So I'm returning it. Of note the ad does say  ""windows latest edition"" which must mean worthless."
1.0,Its cheap and is cheap!,"I would say very disappointed! I have spent more time trying to get things to work or stop working (getting auto hover click off is impossible , search it for windows 10) I guess you get what you pay for. It was cheap but not even worth that money."
1.0,Battery not detected.,"I bought this laptop in June 2018 and On first use I realised the laptop was very slow, eventually I got accustomed to the speed and everything was working smoothly. So we're in November now right. I leave my laptop working perfectly fine the morning then I get back home the evening the laptop can't work without the charger. The laptop keeps saying ""battery not detected"". No the laptop has not fallen. And nothing seems to be wrong with the pins at the back."
5.0,5 stars,"Like others have said, the first thing I did was restore Windows 10 to factory settings. Removed 15 unwanted programs. Then installed all my needed programs. Great laptop for my needs. No gaming, minimal [GoPro] video editing, great “work laptop.”  Fast boot-up and wake-up times."
4.0,Get rid of all those unnecessary programs first.,"I Cleaned off the bloatware (the CPU was running almost to capacity when I got this computer ) and it runs good. It  is not lightening fast, but that is expected for the price. I don't do anything fancy on a computer, so it is OK for me. The power button is a little slow to respond. So far, so good."
1.0,Please do not buy it!,"I wish I never purchased it. It runs SO SLOW, it can barely handle more than one window being open at once. God-forbid you close the laptop and open it back up...once the pin prompt FINALLY DOES come on, the system takes 10 -20 minutes to start recognizing clicks.The keyboard is very difficult to use. I was returned it on second day after I purchase! Please do not buy it!"
5.0,Works great for me!!,"I use this as a travel laptop for my art and it handles photoshop cs5 with no issues. It does come with bloatware, but once you clear those out it's a great laptop. I'll probably buy another one for my husband!"
1.0,Very laggy and slow with tons of bloat ware. **UPDATED REVIEW**,"This laptop is very slow and full of bloat ware. My 10yo bought it for mainly homework, but its very slow and laggy to where he always complains when he has to do his homework on it. He also tried installing Fornite, but it was way too slow and laggy to even play. I do not recommend even for starters."
1.0,Garbage,Bought two computers for the start up of my business. Delivery was quick as always. Fresh out of the box one laptop was fine after updating and the other had issues. The system bios has crashed several times. Blue Screen..
1.0,Junk,This laptop is so slooow don't waste your money I smashed it and threw it in the trash. Just could not wait for it too boot up one more time trying to reset it.
2.0,Not something I would buy again,"Slower than molasses, I had to completely reboot within 2 hours of owning it. It is for sure the last HP I will ever buy. I was on the phone with HP for 1 hour, and they told me to reboot it to factory new. I was told that it would take about 3 hours, but it took 7 hours. The technician told me that I should only buy direct from HP. If this is the kind of service you get from the manufacturer, I am surprised that they have any retailors who attempt to sell these overpriced pieces of junk. Amazon will always have my business, but HP just lost me."
1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS PLASTIC PIECE OF JUN,"I don’t mind the cheap plastic feel to it’s outer shell or that the mouse and camera are from the Stone Age. I have external substitutes for those already (that were very inexpensive),but aside from those points.... this is the SLOWEST computer I have EVER used. IT IS IMPOSSIBLY SLOW!! It takes 15-20 minutes to boot up and needs to be rebooted every few hours. Nothing works well and everything takes several minutes to start or perform any task.  I’ve had this for almost two months and have given up, I’ll be going back to a MacBook to recover from my experience with this terrible machine."
5.0,Worth the Price!,"For the price, this is a great machine. Once you get rid of the soul-sucking junk that HP put on there, you have a solid machine that's lightweight."
2.0,Its ok Update: getting bad,"Nothing to go crazy over. Simple light work lap top. Update: after using for the 3rd time ever I realize how crappy the battery life on this thing is. I runs out of battery in maybe a hour flat. Not to mention its crawling speeds, please don't even attempt multitasking on this laptop. Sometimes it never responds and you have to master shut down because you get no response on screen at all. I took 1 star off."
2.0,"Slow. Loud, constantly running fan.","The fan runs constantly and is loud. It's driving me nuts, and it affects the volume of things you're watching. Also many things load slowly. I read that doing a Windows 10 reset will make it run faster, but I haven't tried that yet. Additionally, he bloatware is really annoying and things keep popping up."
2.0,"I did not get the 2018 new version, windows ...","I did not get the 2018 new version, windows 10 was not updated. Most of the other apps are 2016, so in order for me to use them i have to buy the new versions. So me getting a laptop v.s. a tablet is no diffrent. So the memory is already almost  full of stuff i couldnt use. I got ride of what i could, but its still disappointing. Change the sell info its wrong!"
5.0,Great Laptop for the price,"I just picked it up and it works way better than my other laptop. I read the reviews and depending on what you use the computer for if it runs slow, but new memory... duh!! I only need it for school not daunting tasks like game playing or streaming movies"
1.0,DON'T waste your time and $$$,"I bought this computer a little under a year ago as my personal computer. It's only used for very basics; scan and print every once in awhile, online banking, keeping personal financial documents. No gaming, no major memory usage. It has been a headache!! In the past month, it has reset itself twice now, loosing a lot of documents. It's SLOW. And it doesn't want to sync with my wireless printer anymore, no matter how many times I re-download the drivers. I bought it as an economy computer because again, just basic personal needs. It has not held up to any of my expectations. Don't buy it!!"
5.0,Great for School and Movies,What i love most about this laptop is its speed when using apps; office apps and its nice glossy hd screen when I watch movies and that's that. It could be better but it has all what i need and its a great size and light. Its not big and heavy its big and feather weight. Its a pity everything cant be like this :) .
4.0,Don't listen to the naysayers. Worth the money.,"You're buying the hardware, and to a lesser extent, the Windows license. If you have a problem with the software, change it. The internal stuff in this system is perfectly adequate for most every day use. Where HP, and you, save money is the chassis/finish. It's cheap plastic and it feels like it. This machine could really use another 4GB of RAM, but is definitely worth the money as-is."
1.0,Slow,About 7 years ago I bought a netbook for a bargain. I've been happy with it but over the years the guy has started slowing considerably.
2.0,"This laptop is crap, Please help HP I haven't even had 9 months","A blue screen keeps coming up, turns computer off and boots it back up.  I just start to do something and it shuts off again.  I scanned the barcode that comes up.  Followed and NOTHING it said we can't fix.  I want a replacement then,  I haven't had 9 months.  Please write me back"
1.0,I guess you get what you pay for...,"I bought this laptop to replace a failing one. I just wanted a basic laptop to print out forms, do some light word processing, and watch Youtube. Frankly, this one does not do any of these tasks well if at all. Now to top it off the machine itself will boot ,but the Windows shell won't load. That is on top of the fact that since I have purchased it its just slow. Opening a webpage takes a full minute sometimes and I'm sitting on a 100 mb connection."
4.0,Good Value!,"I purchased this laptop for myself and have been happy with it!  I feel it was a good value being reasonably priced and I use it for work and personal usage.  I have a lot of files stored on it and it still works well.  It has a lot of good options and came programmed with items that are useful to my work.  It is not super lightweight but those types are more costly. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase!  It also arrived quickly!"
5.0,I do enjoy my new laptop,"I do enjoy my new laptop.  They've done wonders with Windows 10 as well.  I was used to a lighted keyboard and touch screen, but this laptop does everything I need at a very reasonable price.  And I purchased a tiny light with USB plug in to light my keys when in a dark area.  So all is well.  Packaged well, delivered timely as expected."
1.0,No Faith in Electronics Purchases on Amazon,"Prior to buying this, I bought two LG phones, and both were basically DOA (Different Seller). Bought this based on HP's reputation, but after using it for 2 weeks, it went into the Blue 'Recovery' screen, and is dead. Spent nearly 3 hours on phone with HP Tech Support, they couldn't make it work or even get Windows to reload. BOTH of the companies they gave me as 'Authorized Warranty Service Centers'  are NOT, including Best Buy.  I think they must sell a lot of factory defective merchandise on Amazon as 'new'. Not sure what to do next."
4.0,"Not what I ordered, but OK","I ordered an HP 15.6"" Laptop, AMD A6-9220 Dual-Core Processor 2.50GHz, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD...I received a Dell Inspiron 3000. I have no idea why, but it is essentially the same so I kept it."
1.0,Trashhhhh!!,The company misleads you. The computer is trash. It is terribly slow and the battery dies within 2 hours. I got a hold of the company to discuss the issues. They essentially told me it was my problem. Do not buy this computer or from Adam shop!!!
1.0,Garbage!!,"You get what you pay for. Bought it for paying bills and checking emails. By far the biggest piece of crap ive ever owned. Right out of the box... slow. Takes 10 minutes to do anything. Turn it on, sit and wait 10 MINUTES. Im assuming theres something wrong with it.... there is no way this needs this much time to boot up. JUNK!!!!"
5.0,Excellent product,"This laptop is very good and fast. No problems until now. However if you need Office this computer has not installed, but I do not need it because I will be working with guitar and sound programs, nothing fancy. But if you really need office and you cannot or want to pay for it, just down load openoffice or staroffice, both open source and very good programs."
5.0,So far so good,"I've had this laptop for 1 month, and so far for me it's a good buy. After deleting a bunch of the bloatware that was installed on this PC, and updating all of the drivers and the Windows OS it's a lot faster. It has some lag in loading programs but will be replacing the hard drive to an SSD soon. That will fix the problem."
1.0,Disappointed,I have not been having a great experience with this laptop since I got it. It moves very slow. I will update in the future
1.0,Slow/returning for refund,"I am returning this computer, once I loaded my pictures and documents and programs I need, it slowed down to less then a crawl.  Had to run the cleaner twice a day to just get it moving.  I use my computer for personal household work, pretty sad when it can not handle that."
1.0,Completely trash,"I regret wasting my money on this laptop, the laptop is really slow and freezes a lot don’t waste your money"
5.0,THE GOOD..,THE GOOD....So far so good. I'm pleased with it.
5.0,Great for school,Bought this laptop for my Husband. He wanted it for school so he could put a new operating system on it. It works much better with the new operating system instead of Windows. He loves it. He is studying to be a Computer programmer/Engineer.
1.0,So slow that it does not work.,"The computer is so slow that it cannot run Windows 10, the windows version it came with."
1.0,Junk - do not buy!,"This computer is a piece of junk. It is bogged down, loads pages super slow - if at all. Sometimes it takes more than 10 minutes to load the home screen. I hate it & wish I could return it."
1.0,Not HP’s finest,"I like the light weight aspect, otherwise this computer hasn’t performed anywhere near expectation. The worst Windows version, SO slow starting up, internet as slow as dial up. I prefer using my iPhone unless I have to use two devices, then I use the laptop. HP failed with this dog."
5.0,Five Stars,"Once again great product and great price from Amazon, love it."
1.0,Keyboard needs replacing in a few months,"Slow, but worst is that it broke in seven months of use.  HP promised to send a box in 24 hours (come and gone, no box) and then will replace keyboard in a week or so, ""5 or 6 days.""  I just wanted something reliable.  Do NOT purchase this one."
3.0,Battery is old,I am noticing it said 6.25 hours for battery life but this laptop may have been used already or refurbished because my battery does not stay on longer than 2 or 3 hours without the charger in. I dont know where to contact the seller or how to. I dont know if this is their issue to take care of or HP's.
1.0,Do NOT recommend!!,"Waste of time and money. Crashes constantly. Very slow. Updates constantly, even after most of the crap was off loaded. DO NOT buy this if you need it for school or work. I bought it as an extra back up for our other computers to watch Netfix, write emails, shop online, etc. Very minimal use. But it still has been a pain and not worth the savings."
1.0,Biggest waste or money and time,"If I could give negative stars I would. Biggest waste of money I have ever spent on anything. First bad review I've written for anything I've ever bought. It is BRAND NEW and it is terrible. Freezes every 2 minutes, won't even load the start button. Everything freezes. I absolutely hate this laptop and the fact that I have to pay for shipping to return it and not get my full money back really sets it off. Never again."
2.0,The laptop does what is supposed to but keeps re-starting ...,"The laptop does what is supposed to but keeps re-starting multiple times, I read the battery could be the problem but mine is always fully charged  so that is not the problem because Windows is not updating anymore. I wish I knew that problem on HP laptops otherwise I would never change from my Lenovo laptop. Always when I'm in the middle of doing something on the laptop it suddenly turn off and re starts for no reason. Unhappy customer."
2.0,Extremely SLOW for even basic web searches.,"Bought since I left my job so I'd have something to use at home.  THE WORSE computer on the planet.  Slow speed times, have to keep re-booting it and have tried all the ""tricks"" to speed it up.  Thought, based on the product description and other reviews, that it would be a good unit for the price.  Boy was I wrong.  Don't waste your money on this horrible, heavy, piece of crap!  Too bad HP because I usually like your products.  If I could return this thing and get something else, I would."
2.0,Price is right and performs well but one of corners ...,Price is right and performs well but one of corners of the laptop screen started to pry open without any reason after 6 months of use. I tried to reach out to seller but cannot locate the seller.
1.0,PC,Don't like Chrome
1.0,"it constantly just cuts off and the battety life sucks, this has been nothing but a problem from ...","OMG what a joke of a laptop, it constantly just cuts off and the battety life sucks, this has been nothing but a problem from day one. I was stupid to throw away the shipping box and now I can't  return it. Very disappointed with this"
1.0,Crashes dies very quickly and good for collecting dust,If you are wanting a laptop good for just Facebook Twitter and YouTube this laptop is great for you. But this laptop has to be the worst! one I have ever purchased. I sit down wanting to do office work while I am doing my work the the laptop crashes loads then starts up again everytime. This laptop cannot hold a charge for more than 45 minutes in my personal opinion it’s not even worth $50
4.0,For the price. Not bad,Haven't really dwellved into it yet but so far good.
1.0,Don’t do it.,"I bought it because it was a decent price for the amount of memory.  First of all...it’s slow.  Second of all...the sound just stopped working after 2 months (and my return window closed after 1 month).  I have done every kind of trouble shooting to get the sound working on this thing, but it was all to no avail.  I don’t know why I keep buying HP laptops."
5.0,what I needed for someone in Africa,"Its works perfectly for the price, I don't know how long it will last but for now it was great for the people I purchased it for the price. It is working as it should be"
1.0,Dead after 6 months of use. HP have the worst Service i ever see,"Bought this computer in April, in September it turns off and never work again. I call HP Service, at this time I was in Guatemala, so they told me they cant do anything because this model doesn't sell in that country, so I have to send to the US. I told them I will be in US in November, so I call HP service in the US in November and they say, sorry warranty is expired. Case Number 5020811620.  Never bought another HP product in my life !!!!!!!!."
4.0,Typical HP Product,"Too much useless software comes with, but once uninstalled, good unit. Processes fast and works well."
1.0,... all I could afford and I should have known better.,it was all I could afford and I should have known better.
1.0,Don't Buy.,"This is without a doubt the worst computer I have ever had. The cursor constantly freezes, it is slower than slow. It locks up, requiring a reset. I have 3 older laptops that I have retired but I have started using them again because either of them is much better than this HP."
4.0,"Nice Laptop, works great for those who just need ...","Nice Laptop, works great for those who just need a laptop for everyday use, the only downfall is it is not able to connect to 5G wifi connections on wireless routers. But overall, a good computer."
2.0,Hidden programs that take control of your computer,This computer has hidden programs that track everything you do and captures all of your information.  It takes control when you are trying to make a purchase and goes into your downloads and who know what is being done with the information.  I hate it.  Buyer beware.
1.0,Don't buy this piece of crap it keeps on freezing when you surfing the Web,"Don't buy this piece of crap it keeps on freezing when you surfing the Web,  Now it's frozen  It's a large paper weight"
4.0,Worth it,"Satisfied for my purposes of online classes. Battery life is less than I’d like, but for the price you can’t beat it."
3.0,"Mine didn’t work , so probly I’m not a good reviewer of this product",Didn’t work. Had to send it back. I almost never send stuff back. I may have just got a bad one. Didn’t give 1 star cause returning it was easy.
2.0,So this laptop worked fine but the start up was very slow each time ...,"So this laptop worked fine but the start up was very slow each time I turned it on. Also when I watched Netflix (which is one of the main reasons I wanted a laptop) the screen glitched out and was very laggy. I had to return it because the quality was so poor, I don't recommend unless the only thing you're looking for is browsing the web but even then it's super slow and the battery lasts about an hour."
5.0,Great space,Great computer for the price works great for my eight year old sons and his online school games
4.0,Not bad!,"For the most part, I like it.  I don't like the power button because it is hard to tell if it is on until the screen actually comes on.  And I don't like the way the screen flashes when it updates."
5.0,Great quality,This laptop has everything I need I am very pleased with my purchase.

4.0,It’s nice for the price!,I don’t use my laptop that much. It’s nice for the price but I barely use it and it’s kinda slow. Still happy with it considering the price.
4.0,good computer for the money.,The battery doesn't hold a charge very long.  The laptop is a little slow.  It was easy to setup.  A lot of software that I will never use. Does anyone know how to avoid signing in every time I use the laptop?
5.0,"It's a great laptop, I got it a couple days ago ...","It's a great laptop, I got it a couple days ago and so far it's been working great. Not slow at all and can have a lot of apps o  it, besides it has great memory space."

5.0,I would recommend this product,I've had this laptop for 2 1/2 months. It's a great laptop. Easy to use.
3.0,Prepare to wait.,"After loading up and running through all of the updates, removing most all of the bloatware, this pc is not that impressive. The cooling fan runs constant and is kind of annoying. It seems like the proccessor never stops thinking. It's always at 39% use or above. HP has a ton of its own bloatware that runs and you cannot remove it from the startup sequence. Not nice HP. I guess if you had your own, clean copy of windows, this would be a nice laptop."

1.0,Doesn’t Work Appropriately for Basic Use,"This is THE WORST and slowest laptop I’ve ever used.  I have high speed internet and use it JUST for internet and it doesn’t work.  I’m very patient and not one to typically leave reviews, but I wouldn’t recommend for anyone to purchase."

5.0,Good price,Great gift
4.0,Very Good For a Cheap Gaming Laptop,"It's an excellent laptop for the price; definitely more than passable for gaming.  It can get a bit laggy when trying to open too many windows at once.  I use it for streaming and recording video games; so far I've only attempted emulators and indie games like Undertale, and I fear it might not perform so well for more demanding games."
1.0,Slow piece of trash,Garbage. Mcafee virus takes 10 hours to uninstall. To slow to do anything. Put it in the trash

5.0,Five Stars,Very good shipping and it's neeew
1.0,Slow Slow Slow,This is the slowest new computer I have ever owned. I removed all junk software before ever even logging on as recommended but this POS still takes forever to do anything. Click a button - prepare to wait a good minute or longer for a response. Expected a lot better from HP. Very disappointed.
1.0,A piece of crap .very slow.,Battery does not last no more than 1 hour. I brought it in May 2018.
