5.0,a good laptop,"I got this a week ago and, so far, is quite good. Solid. The one disadvantage is that on my previous laptops, I could use regular CD-Rs but this one requires the Music CD-Rs. The backlight for the keyboard does eat up battery time."
5.0,Great value,"After 2 weeks, this nice looking computer has performed as fast as advertised. I have been working with heavy Excel files but no gaming. Well worth the price for a 17"" laptop with an Intel i5 chip!"
5.0,Almost Perfect!,"People often come to me for advice when they want a computer built, or to buy a Laptop, so I've evaluated a lot of them. Now it was time to do it for myself."
5.0,Good buy!,I liked the price and decided to take a chance. It's a great laptop. The screen is clear  I love the spacious key board with the number pad. But I bought it for college and this is a very large screen I wished I would have went smaller. But other than that. I can run all my programs and Sims 4.
5.0,Awesome laptop,Love this laptop. Love the feel of the keyboard. Backlit keyboard helps at night.
5.0,Well made laptop,"I bought this HP because it is the current version of my prior machine, which served me well for several years. Only surprise was that the case was a tiny amount wider than my prior machine, so it did not fit the protective sleeve in my briefcase."
5.0,The sc4ee,It does what claims to do. It is quick all around. Worth the money. I would recommend this computer to anyone wanting an extended basic laptop.
5.0,great service good product,fast delivery
