4.0,"Easy upgrade, solid performer.",I've found three real cons for this laptop:
4.0,Fast Value Laptop with Washed Out Screen,SUMMARY
3.0,Install a 128gb SSD drive and Reinstall Win 10 and you will be very happy,update 11/13/18 - still quite happy with this laptop...works well so far..
5.0,Exceeds expectations for the price,"Bought this as a gift for my dad.. he just needed something to surf the web and play videos.  I bought this along with a 256GB ADATA SSD ($55) that I immediately installed with no issues.  The panel at the back has 3 screws that need to be removed and has a notch on one side that can be used to pry it open, it requires a little pressure to pop out but not too much.  You will find a m.2 slot to pop in a SATA3 ssd.  The retaining screw is included."
4.0,Very nice value laptop,"This is a nice setup for under $400. The laptop features the Intel i3-8130U 8th generation (latest generation for 4/2018, a 2 core processor), a 1TB drive and 6gb RAM.  The battery is supposed to last for 12 hours (I tested this a bit but not a lot).  The laptop has 6gb, a read/write DVD drive, and a lot of connections and a 1920 x 1080 display."
5.0,Nice,"I’m not the most tech savvy person on earth. My old PC was starting to become unreliable, and I knew I needed to replace it before it died. I did a bit of comparison shopping on Amazon, and decided on this Acer. It has lots of space and is fast enough for me. I do not play games on this laptop, so I don’t know anything about graphics, etc. I feel I got a great laptop for the price, and it suits my simple needs."
5.0,Solid product,"Very happy-shipping was prompt & product worked out of the box.--have only had small issues w/Windows 10, after experience w/Windows7 & Chrome (wife still prefers Chrome)  Wehave found Cortana the voice Assistant to be very helpful, when neither of us thought it would matter. Screen picture quality is fine-really don't know what people expect, especially at under $400.. SOUND IS WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED, & WE BOTH LOVE OUR MUSIC.. Everything works & is well laid out. The speed is like greased lightning, compared to our old equipment  I appreciate the ease of serviceability offer by Acer on the bottom-only 3 screws."
4.0,"Defrag and cleanup, then you have a great laptop!","This is a great laptop if you immediately run maintenance checks on it (defrag, disk cleanup) and remove a little bloatware. It is not a laptop to game with, but as a working/school laptop, you're getting a great bang for your buck. Only giving it four stars just because of the above mentioned things I did afterward, but by no means is this a horrible laptop."
1.0,S.L.O.W!,"Started out good, but became increasingly slow with updates.  I got rid of the bloat and this thing struggles to open programs and browser pages.  I want to like this, but it is irritatingly slow!"
5.0,Fantastic budget laptop In need of a simple drive upgrade,Fantastic product. This laptop is a step up from the previous product which only had the skylake 6 series. The 8th gen processor handles some really impressive things for the price. The only thing is that pesky 5400rpm hard drive. Simply buy a 2.5” ssd and a Sata to USB adapter. Plug the drive into the pc and use macrium reflect to copy the drive as soon as the computer is set up. Then pop out the old drive and insert the new ssd. It blows even my aging desktop out of the water. Even without a discreet card the graphics are impressive. It easily outputs 4K with less than 50% draw on integrated graphics. Although it might be limited for rendering and such. My biggest qualm is that the older model had a backlit keyboard that was great. I would have gladly paid 400 for this laptop if it only had that backlighting. As far as budget laptops go this acer is fantastic.
1.0,"Was great for a couple of weeks, then...","Worked great for about 2 weeks, then became very slow to load and respond. Scanned for virus, but unable to figure out why it was running so slow. Returning it for a refund."
5.0,A treasure in disguise ;-)," So far so impressive! From what everyone else was saying I didnt expect much. But it's just what I need. I was surprised to kno its run by microsoft & not google. You need a Microsoft account to setup this bad boy so if you're an xbox/outlook kind of person all the better, this pc is for you! Just like ""ok google"" ""Bixby"" & ""Alexa"". This has ""Cortona"" idk if she's a Microsoft or a windows 10 thing but she's voice activated & apart of this laptop, she's very helpful. I thought I was unable to get a lot of stuff on this device, but you can. You have to build it, it's like it comes empty so to speak aside from the preinstalled apps, you can uninstall & install the drivers & apps you like, like a media player, google play, & if u need more memory it's an option too on amazon, All hope is not lost' its cooperative & leave room for what u want to install. If ur an IT u can put it to good use & if not, it's simple for those  who aren't. I feel fortunate to have gotten this laptop at this price. You can play roblox, minecraft & probably fortnite. It also has a CD/DVD drive/burner, it holds battery life for 12hrs. Think about' your going to pay a good 800 for another. It's a steal to me!"
1.0,Hard Drive failed at 7 months,"I bought this May 15, 2018 based on reviews.  It stopped working yesterday, rather started working strangely.  Today I called for tech support only to find the warranty expired at 6 months.  The tech support person was kind and knowledgeable but did not tell me that my service expired until he found what he said was corrupted data and that he would be able to fix the data if the for a fee of $129 for a year other options for 2 and 3 years at higher rates.  I decided I wanted to get a second opinion and took it to a local computer shop who told me that the hard drive was bad. The cost of a new hard drive, reinstall the operating system, recover my data files and transfer to the new hard drive was quoted just under the total amount I paid for the computer at $379.  The hard drive going bad at 7 months, I am very disappointed and disturbed."
3.0,Good home laptop - keep expectations realistic," I loved the price for the 8th generation Intel Core i3. I didn't like that the correct Intel UHD Graphics 620 video driver was not installed. I had to go to Intel's website, download and install the right driver, which did then improve performance over the Microsoft Basic video driver."
1.0,Shuts off Randomly,I bought this for work because I dont need a lot of fancy features to email and use microsoft office.  Within a few days computer randomly cut off and I thought it was something I had done wrong.  But it has done it several more times within the last two week in the middle of while I was working.  One time it did it when I unplugged the power cord (yes it was fully charged).  I know other people feel like they have a good product here but I feel like I got what I paid for with a discount computer
4.0,"Reliable, Fast and Durable Laptop...if you make some changes and upgrades","I bought this laptop few weeks ago and am overall very happy with the purchase. However, as others have suggested, there are three things you should consider to do in order to reach this laptop's full potential:"
4.0,Very good home computer with subpar hard drive,"I bought this laptop for my sophomore who wanted one in his dorms to do his home work, mostly browsing, and MS office (or equivalent). The feature I am most impressed with is its long battery life, wow, just wow. The laptop looks good, it feels good, its light weight and relatively thin. Its keyboard is not that great, feels little flimsy and it perhaps is flimsy. Like some other reviewers have mentioned, the screen colors are not vivid and it was real pain to watch some old low resolution movies; the colors were acceptable for more recent movies though. Sound, well, thats kind of weak too but some decent quality bluetooth speakers/headphones can be connected without much hassle."
1.0,So SLOW!!!! Horrible,Absolutely horrible.... the SLOWEST computer I’ve ever had from the minute I turned it on. Takes about 10 minutes to load up and forget about searching the internet for something...it’s so SLOW!!! My 10 year old laptop filled with 5000 pictures is faster than this laptop
2.0,I expected better from Acer.,"The first day I had this Acer E5-576-392H home, I noticed the battery level was at 85% (plugged in, charging). After lunch, it was still at 85%. The next morning, it was still at 85%. I disconnected the charging cord and the computer immediately died and wouldn't turn back on under battery power."
4.0,"nice laptop, fast and does everything I want it to.","My HP and DELL had a few bells and whistles that I miss on this ACER. Other than the aforementioned, for speed, functionality and price this laptop is excellent!"
5.0,Easily upgradable including the Bios. This is NOT a Gaming Laptop!,"Very easy to upgrade to make a very fast laptop. I used Macrium Reflect Free (easy to find on the net) to clone the slow HDD to a Adata SU800 M.2 2280 256GB SSD. I replaced the 6GB Ram provided (1x4GB + 1x2GB) with 2x4GB Crucial DDR3L 1600mhz Ram sticks. There are 3 screws on the bottom to remove to access both. A piece of cake. One note; when I first started the laptop back up after replacing the Ram, it wouldn't boot up. I then swapped the old Ram back in and it booted fine. I could not find an answer for this online so I just tried swapping the new Ram back in again. It worked this time! I held down the power button until it booted. Everthing is fine now. It boots up in about 5 sec. Also, when you boot it up for the first time after cloning the HDD, it will automatically boot to the SSD. To get into Bios just press F2 and hold as soon as you see the Acer logo when booting up. There is new Firmware for the Bios at the Acer website and also fixes for the Intel chip hacks (Specter and Meltdown). You should probably do these ASAP."
1.0,P.O.S.,Very disappointed. So called high speed high power wi fi  is b.s.! Can't get online with enough speed to even update. Rubbish.
5.0,"Not for gamers or those into massive amounts of high speed surfing, but perfect for us old farts just wanting to dabble","Writing this review on this machine. I needed a machine that would allow me to work with my personal photos, music files and of coarse the internet. I don't venture into gaming so I didn't need a processor that could outrun the speed of light and I'm not a DJ or professional photographer. So this machine is much better than what I had. My only dislike is the way Microsoft tries to tell you how and what you will run on Windows10 rather than letting the user make that choice. Otherwise great battery life and fast charging. Very quick boot up and shut down. And the size to weight ratio is even better than I thought."
1.0,$360 Russian Roulette!,"I set my expectations low with the price point of this laptop, but expected it to function at the very least. Unfortunately it cannot. It’s incredibly slow, which isn’t a big deal, expected at $360, but it will not update. I cannot get windows to update. I had it downloading updates for 5 hours and the final download wouldn’t pass 6% even after sitting for over an hour for this download alone. If you use the internet at all do not purchase this. Web pages take a while to load, or won’t load completely, regardless of browser. Meanwhile I hop on my desktop, phone, any other device and the internet works flawless so I know my internet is fine. Went through and updated all the drivers without any success. Videos won’t load either. Yeah, the screen is 1080p, but if you try to watch a random youtube video at just 720p, it cannot go more than 5-10 seconds without buffering for 3-4x that amount. I tried resetting the laptop and have spent hours attempting to make this work. Maybe a defective model, but something is definitely wrong. My old HP Pavilion that was 5 years old worked better. If you purchase this laptop make sure you have a smartphone or something so you can watch youtube videos to bypass the wait of loading your favourite homepage or email."
5.0,Probably the most bang for your buck under$400,"USB 3.0, USB-C, 1080 screen, 1TB HDD, no sacrifice in CPU age/gen (8th gen i3) and no hot & hungry AMD."
4.0,Good value laptop for Ubuntu after upgrade to a SSD,"I was looking to upgrade my old Acer Aspire, and I chose this model as a good budget option for basic home productivity use.  Looking at the specifications for the computer, the components that I most wanted to change were the mechanical hard drive and the mismatched pair of DIMMs that will prevent operating in dual-channel mode.  Fortunately, the laptop is designed to make both of those components easily replaceable."
5.0,Acer E 15 E5-576-392H with added 512GB NVMe PCIe SSD and 16GB Memory," Very nice laptop PC for the price, though the screen could be brighter and the viewing angle wider, and there will those those who complain that the keyboard isn't back-lit and that there's no Nvidia gaming video adapter. What do you want for $329?"
1.0,This is my second Acer laptop they have sent me with bad hardware.,"I have bought 2 laptops in the past 2 years from Acer.  They are the only Acer products I have ever bought, and they are the only ones I will ever buy.  The first was a Helios 300.  Though their service professionals are amiable enough their ability to help is hamstrung by Acer's policies.  The only recourse anyone ever has with their product is to ship it in to their repair centers where the the initial level of diagnostics is totally insufficient.  My first laptop had a motherboard problem but they sent it back to me without repair.  The problem persisted and they had to elevate my problem to someone who actually sounded like they knew anything about computers.  I finally got a usable computer a full month and half after I ordered which makes one ask if I should even both with Amazon's 2-day shipping.  The second laptop has a bad HDD.  I KNOW it's a bad HDD.  I've confirmed it in several different ways and just want to replace the HDD.  I'm overseas and sending it in will cost more than the laptop is worth, but does that matter?  Nope.  Will the service representative refer me to a supervisor?  Nope.  Their ONLY recourse they're allowed is send it in.  If you won't send it in, we won't do anything about the bad HDD we gave you.  If you get a functional laptop you probably will never have to deal with these folks, but I'm batting a 1000 on Acer products here with failed hardware shipped in them.  Either I'm extremely unlucky, or Acer's quality control is the worst I've ever seen."
1.0,Look for a different product,The computer is extremely slow. Much of what needs to be done takes quite some time or doesn't happen at all. Installing simple software is a pain. I returned the item immediately as soon as I dug into it.
5.0,Change the HDD to an SSD!,"For the price, it's a great college laptop. Student programs like Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, Mail all run without issue thanks to the 8th gen Intel CPU. It delivered snappy desktop performance (when I changed the HDD) and has up-to-date ports (like the USB-C port). If I could recommend one thing, it would be to change the HDD to an SSD. Then, you would get rid of the bottleneck that is the cheap accompanied hard disk drive. Not only was it slow and choppy, it was also making louder-than-normal reading noise. Replacing it to a 240GB SSD solved all my problems."
4.0,Its a hobby just by itself!,"Okay, I am definitely not a typical user.  I got this because it had excellent reviews and everyone said it was a fantastic deal hardware vs value.  (I purchased it at $324, although I missed the $315 price which was only there for less than a day) Everyone also mentioned that it only started feeling peppy after the mechanical HDD was replaced by an SSD."
5.0,Incredible!!!!,Definitely worth the buy! Great laptop for the money . Works great!
5.0,"Definitely a buy, if you aren't picky.",bought 11-24-2018
1.0,Nightmare. Total Nightmare,"I hesitate to leave such a horrible review but it has been a 5 day nightmare for me and it does't seem to be over yet. The browser would close on its own and open a random window that I did not open. I heard myself talking through the laptop speakers and looked behind the window I had open and was staring back at myself because the computer had opened Skype all by itself. Suddenly, I couldn't open any items on the desktop. The cursor would move but clicking on items wouldn't open them. It wouldn't type into the search bar, and the Windows Icon (far bottom left) wouldn't open to allow me to reboot. I had to force reboot by holding the power button (which I hate to do). Then, the ""restarting"" wheel just swirled and swirled... When I tried to backup my files by plugging in my external hard drive, it recognized it okay and opened the window to show the files, while I was looking it, it suddenly closed that window and opened another window. Then, while transferring files from the laptop to the external drive, I started getting the message, ""Are you sure you want to save this file without its properties""? WTH? Also, when I clicked the Windows Icon (lower left) that opens to show the programs in alphabetic order, suddenly before my eyes, all names and icons of the programs disappeared and a random alphabet appears... A B C D etc with no names or icons. But, when I clicked the Windows Icon again, it all came back. It literally felt like there was a ghost in the laptop or someone was controlling it from elsewhere. I  have been on the phone with Amazon, Acer, and even Microsoft Windows.  I had already spent two days re-installing all my files and software (winzip, video editing software, Microsoft Word, Norton) only to ultimately restore Windows to factory settings while on the phone with Microsoft. This is when the problem occurred while trying to backup my files to the external drive... which caused me to fear that my external device was now corrupted. That device held 8 years of research with documents and images I had created. It held the backup of 4 books I had written, the family tree book I had been working on since 2012, and all our ancestors photos I had restores and only I had this family data. I had my wedding photos and photos of my deceased mother who just passed and my deceased brother who died in 1976 in a car accident, my daughter's baby pictures... So, I was horrified when I plugged the drive in after the factory restore and got the message that the external drive was not recognized. Thankfully! Thankfully! My brother helped me retrieve my data from it. I had bought my husband the exact same laptop but from another vendor and his didn't have these problems. The seal on my laptop had not been broken but Amazon customer service had said, ""So, you bought this on Nov 14th"". No... I bought it on Nov 29th. Then she said, ""No problem, I'll just change that for you"". Which makes me wonder what happened between Nov 14th and the 29th? A fluke? Last night around 1am, my Kindle starts alerting me of Yahoo email login failures and something about failures to log into Amazon through my Yahoo email. This is a full 5 days after this all started. So, at 2 am I up changing all my passwords to every account I own; my bank, Paypal, Amazon, Yahoo email... etc'.  I have demanded that Acer investigate by tracing the laptop though its SN number but am told they can't do that. It is their responsibility to ensure that their customer receive a clean computer. I have been emotionally exhausted, emotionally distraught, mentally exhausted and physically exhausted and I shouldn't have had to go through this. Customers should't have to restore their laptop Windows back to factory settings. But, my husband's laptop was fine. Somebody, somewhere, did something to the laptop I received and I feel it should be investigated. Maybe this feedback will make that happen. Or, maybe they will just come after me instead. That would be a lot easier than tracing where their corrupted laptop came from."
4.0,Get the SSD version (or swap in your own) for best results,"Summary: If you stick to the default configuration - 6GB RAM, 1TB spinning drive - you are likely to get frustrated with this laptop (2.5-3 stars). It can be very responsive at times, but for the first several minutes after every boot it is painfully slow, with the hard drive pegged at 100% usage. Replacing the hard drive with an SSD or M.2 SSD will make it feel like a completely different laptop (4+ stars), with few of the bottlenecks. As long as you're not gaming heavily or editing video, it's a solid performer - on par with my aging Core i7-3770 desktop."
4.0,"Don't worry about playing games, it does most at okay to passable framerates.",Fantastic laptop! Runs most games i've thrown at it and it's easily upgradeable. I'm installing an SSD and running windows and apps off of it and using the included 1TB HDD as storage until i can get an SSD for storage as well. The battery life is excellent and it was almost entirely clear from the random crap most big box retailers slam into their off the shelf machines (removed the antivirus included as it doesn't hold a candle to avast).
5.0,Was able to use old HDD with new SSD,"This Acer Aspire E 15, 15.6"" Full HD, 8th Gen Intel Core i3-8130U, 6GB RAM Memory, 1TB HDD, 8X DVD, E5-576-392H was purchased for my wife to use.  She doesn’t do video games or anything in any way computationally intensive.  At the time of purchase (April 2019), the price was $329.  I read a lot of the reviews and appreciated all the helpful information.  People were recommending installing a solid state drive (SSD) to reduce boot time and increasing the memory (RAM) size to allow the computer to operate faster.  I decided in advance of ordering this computer to do both of those things. I hope this review will be useful and maybe address some of the difficulties reported by others."
5.0,Good product. I3-8130u is great.,Good product. I3-8130u.
4.0,USB3 Count and lacking battery information.,"As of September 3rd 2018, the e5-576-392H tech details on the amazon web page states that the laptop has three (3) USB3 ports however it only has two. The ACER web page for this product has the correct information. I would advise the buyer to review the ACER web page before purchase. I did flag amazon on this point."
3.0,glitchy power settings can lock the laptop up,"This laptop has been pretty glitchy for me in terms of locking up when it goes to sleep, and in not keeping the color and brightness settings consistently. I was going to return the laptop at first but after reading reviews and playing with some settings decided to keep this, given the price point can't really be beat, and that this was mostly meant to be a portable web browser and DVD player for me to use in the bedroom. If I needed it for anything heavier than that, I would have sent it back."
1.0,Very disappointed . A waste of my money .,After 2 months it would not turn on .. I was told it's a hardware problem .
1.0,Horrible,This computer isnterribly slow it does not have powerful processing and the battery doesn’t last 13.5 hours. Half of the info on this laptop is dalse
5.0,Great value in a good performing laptop.,"This computer is a great value.  Unfortunately I have never like Windows 10, so I use a different operating system.  There is quite a bunch of crapware preloaded, but it only takes a bit of time to delete all of that.  Speed and memory are really good.  I bought mine on Prime Day and am completely satisfied with the product.  I've had other Acer laptops before and have always gotten good service from them.  This is a good computer at a good price."
1.0,Why make a nice computer with a screen you cannot see?,"I would have given this device five stars. The black light picture is horrible on this computer and is washed out. Meaning if you do not sit perfectly still at a certain point, you still you cannot see the screen at 100%. Returned it immediately and got my money back. Thank god amazon is awesome with returns. Ended up buying a different laptop that blew away this screen for 500$. This is not a defect it is the way they built it and went super cheep on the screen quality. Do not buy it, is not worth the money. Make sure when it says HD it is 1080 To myself their HD picture quality is misleading to say the least. I'm sure other reviews state the same problem TY"
5.0,"Good laptop, easy to upgrade","I bought this to replace a 12 year old Lenovo ThinkPad that was still kicking but starting to slow down. Some of the main things I was looking for with a new laptop was a 1080p display, an optical drive, the ability to install an SSD, and a decent processor, all for about $300. The first thing I did with this laptop was replace the 1TB HDD with a 250GB Samsung SSD, which was quite easy. It took me a bit to realize the drive needed to slide horizontally to be unplugged before being lifted out (duh). I may increase the RAM in the future, but for the time being, 6GB is sufficient. Overall I'm quite pleased with this laptop. It's working well as a light-duty computer for browsing the internet, streaming movies, and doing some light processing when I'm not at my main workstation. It boots quickly and generally works as expected. The build quality is not the same as the ThinkPad, but I wasn't expecting that since the ThinkPad was a top-end model in it's day and was quite solidly built. Overall I'm happy with the laptop as it does all I expected it to do and has an excellent battery life."
3.0,Cheap feeling case - raised edges,"I do not hate this computer, but I do not love it either.  The case is incredibly cheap feeling.  The edges are slightly raised from the keyboard deck and it is uncomfortable to touch.  The Acer I replaced was a tank and this is much lighter.  The keyboard is somewhat mushy and I find I start my fingers on the wrong keys much more frequently and I am an expert typist, so this is strange.  Internet connectivity is much slower than on the SIX year old machine I replaced.  I picked this machine for the ultra cheap price, but I thought it would be better than it is.  The specs are ok and are sufficient for what I do, e.g. play games on POGO, stream movies, Hulu, tv shows, etc. I am planning on doing some transcription work and I am hoping this Acer is up to the challenge."
5.0,Great buy...Great Laptop,"This Laptop is great. The sound and picture is sharp and the speed and ease of used has been quite surprising. I am not a gamer...just a regular Senior that needed a new and easy to use Laptop after my older Acer computer went Kaput! I am so happy to have found this Laptop...and the price was amazing!!! Best Christmas gift , ever! I have owned 2 other Acer computers and I have to say this one is the best one yet ! The improved speakers and the improved pleasure in watching movies and other videos is a great upgrade. Now I can watch my cat videos without them hanging up....LOLOLOL.....This is a great buy for anyone looking for a good all around laptop and Windows 10 was already installed and updated. I was afraid of Windows 10 but this laptop had it rolled out and was so simple to start up and use. Thank you Acer for a great and easy to use laptop. I am a dedicated Acer consumer !!"
5.0,Better than expected! Get one!,"1, love it."
5.0,Great budget laptop that is easily upgraded,"Out of the box this is a great budget laptop. Build quality is good-very good, screen is very good (better than most reviews indicate), keyboard layout is okay, touch pad is smooth and responsive, and the laptop works exactly as it is supposed to. My only concern is the flimsiness of the power supply and my only gripe is the lack of backlit keyboard. But over all this is a solid 5 star laptop in its price range of $379 and ridiculously good for the $319 I paid for it on Black Friday. After spending a day with it I popped off the bottom plate and doubled the RAM to 12gb and added a 128gb M.2 SSD. Wow! This thing was reasonably fast before, now it's blazing. Makes my HP 850 G2 with 5th gen i5 processor and 8gb of RAM seem slow. Do not hesitate to buy this laptop, especially if you have an extra $26 for an SSD. Unless you get a rare Acer lemon you will be very pleased."
5.0,"BUY YOURS NOW!  Or get screwed.  Oh, nice machine.","My machine was dying so I ordered this one...two days before Black Friday.  Had no choice.  Now you can get it for $55 less than I did two days ago.  I will say that is a great machine and you are getting a lot for your dollar.  Don't be concerned that you can't get much computer for this price...nothing could be further from the truth.  I am very happy with it.  Plenty fast.  Get rid of the bloatware (like the installed Norton...and find a not so intrusive security software) that it comes loaded with and that drive won't have to hunt and peck so much.  I added an 8 gig flash drive and configured it for dedicated Ready Boost (gonna have to Google that one).  If you already have an external SSD you could configure about 4 gigs of that for RB. Sped things up by about 5-10% depending. Not bad for $8.  Things got snappy.  Plenty of RAM (8 would be nicer but 6 will do.  At 5,400 MHz the drive is not the fastest but as I said if you keep it clean you will be well served.  Unless you are gaming I suspect you will really like this machine.  If you have questions just ask."
4.0,Reasonable and nice,LIKES
2.0,Disappointed with quality of an old favorite,PRO:
2.0,Screen turns off and won't turn back on if I close the lid when the laptop is on.,"Screen turns off and won't turn back on if I close the lid when the laptop is on.  It isn't on ""sleep"", ""standby"" or ""hibernate"". I disabled those functions from happening automatically in the power settings. I have cats and if i leave my laptop screen up while I'm not working on it, my cats will walk over the keyboard. I've always just closed the lid to go to the bathroom/kitchen whatever. I come back and lift the lid and 50% of the time, the screen won't light back up. I have to press and hold the ""power"" button on keyboard, lose my work and reboot it. It's frustrating and annoying. So now, I have to manually put my computer to ""sleep"", close the lid and then wait for ""sleep"" to come back. Sounds like it's not a big deal, but gmail doesn't receive new emails while on sleep etc. I have to refresh some tabs. That's the only bad thing about this laptop."
3.0,Its ok for the price but some issues,"I got it yesterday.  It was pretty easy to install except it would not accept my email passwords.  Kept telling me they were incorrect.  For setting up with Microsoft, you have to do this.  It did take my phone number thou and send me a text so I managed to get thru the process that way.  Not thrilled about that.  Why it did not take my CORRECT password is fishy to me.  Anyway, I was frustrated with the slowness of it.  I also had issues with the battery.  It says right on the labtop 12 hours battery power.  Well it would not give me more than say 3.75 hours when I clicked on the bottom battery icon.  So I charged it more over night.  Got up and checked it out.  It gave me 4.75 approx hours.  I fiddled around with batter power settings and finally called them.  We went thru a lengthy process of resetting the battery.  At the end he told me that I just have to time the battery myself.  See if it stays on the twelve hours despite what the icon says on the bottom of the screen.  Ok, just great.  Also had an issue with screen size shrinking.  You know its fine them wamb, you touch the touch key pad and it shrinks your page down to tiny itsy bitsy can't read?  You have no clue why.  Well he showed me what to do.  You go to the upper right and click on the setting icon, top of page.  Mine is three lines.  Search for zoom and put it on 100 or whatever you want.  What a pain, but atleast I know what to do.  I wanted to turn this option off.  He said that is not possible.  Don't care for that.  Pluses of the laptop.  Price is good.  The customer service was good, but he had a thick latino accent and I had to insist he slow down.  I could not understand a single word he said.  What's up with that?  He was nice thou, slowed down and we managed to get thru it all, but it was work trying to understand him.  Lots of ""what?""  or ""I can't undrestand you.  Say it again.""  Oh boy.....set up was pretty easy.  I'm still not sure about it to be honest.  I sure hope I don't end up sending it back.  That's my take thou."
1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER - 100% disk usage makes it slow as a sloth,Summary:
4.0,Slow start and flaws but still works.🤗,Bought this because my HP 2000 Notebook that I had for years been acting up and running really slow lately where I try lot of stuff to speed it up but nothing is worked.
1.0,Old computer performance at a new computer price,"First and foremost, I'm not as computer savvy as some of the reviewers on here, so take this review for what it is. I'm just an average computer user."
1.0,returning but am going to order another one,"sending this back for refund, wanted a replacement but was not given that option. I like it for a couple days than started making crunchy like noise. The noise concerns me. And one time it would not turn back on until I plugged it into power supply-the battery read at 60%, no clue what that was about. The computer has good reviews and the price is good so I am going to take chance and order another one as soon as refund is token care of. After I have new one for couple weeks I will update this review."
4.0,Great value laptop with minor caveat,"I purchased this laptop for the purpose of browsing the internet, minor content creation (writing papers for college), and some media consumption (streaming video). This laptop has delivered on all of these objectives. However, the one caveat is this: the laptop comes with a 1 TB mechanical hard drive that is clearly the bottleneck of this system. I replaced this hard drive within a few weeks of purchasing this laptop due to debilitating performance. I installed a value priced solid state hard drive from a major manufacturer and the performance of this laptop was instantly improved. I would not recommend this laptop unless you plan to replace the hard drive with an SSD. Thankfully the laptop has a very convenient M.2 slot for newer SSD's."
4.0,The display leaves you wanting,I agree with others who said that the display is a little washed out. While it doesn't have a great display it otherwise performs very well for an inexpensive laptop. This was a gift for my grandson and he's quite happy with it so that's all that counts.
5.0,Accepts NVMe M.2 Drive,very happy with this for my travel and power outages computer first thing I did was make a recovery drive following the instructions (took about 1 hour 15 minutes to make the drive) then put in an NVMe M.2 drive ( yes it can use an NVMe drive) and used recovery drive to set it up and booted to it much faster than with 5400RPM spinner boot times average 13 seconds used Crystal disk mark 6 to test speed and sequential speed are 1056.0 read 403.7 write. Ordered a 8GB RAM stick to bring it to 12GB RAM instead of the 6GB easy simple to do all the work 3 screws on bottom plate  pry off the cover the spin drive is simple pull back and slip out save in case you plan to trade off or sell it later and put the M.2 drive in and change out ram all under one cover simple easy to do even my Mother could understand. I tested the computer for time on battery power with DVD playing for 4 hours then music for 3 hours got down to 6% battery 41 minutes battery using external speakers that are only powered by the laptop not their own power source. Took about 2.5 hours with unit off to fully recharge the battery today I tested it with an external Bluray drive it played a 2 hour movie with about 1 hr 47 minutes remaining battery. WARNING if you create a recovery drive and use a larger drive than 16GB like I used a 64GB it partitioned the drive to a 32GB drive  and left the unused part UN-formatted I could not shrink it with disk management it totally re-formats the drive I able to use Partition Wizard to re-partition it to 16GB for recovery and the rest for DATA.
3.0,"""NOT IMPRESSED"" WITH THIS LAPTOP  Plus (BATTERY ONLY LASTED 3 MONTHS)","UPDATE:  DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP, UNLESS YOU WANT TO REPLACE THE BATTERY EVERY 3 MONTHS.  I've used this stupid thing wireless 6 or 7 times and the battery is now DOA.  I don't know how they can claim with a straight face that you can get 12 or 13 hours out of their battery, when I only got 4 hours, when it I hooked it up in December 2018.  At the end of February, 2019, I needed a new battery.  The batteries are junk and these computers are JUST TOO CHEAP.  put out a hundred more bucks and buy something decent!!!"
4.0,Ok for backup PC. Good for price.,"Bought this as it could be delivered next day due to my Sager laptop took a fall and cracked screen. As I use my main  laptop for work stuff 90% of the time, and have a high end unit, this is a snail in comparison with having only a i3 processor. The i3 is good for basic no frills computing, but don't try to run multiple programs. For me it is a painful realization going from i7-4700  down to a i3 to fill in for a week till mine gets repaired, then ether give away or stick in closet if needed for emergency. I use win 7 pro, so using win 10 home is painful as it has to much crap and slows the system even more. Pros: looks nice, is light, very small brick, keyboard feel is very good. This is a great starter unit and  would be good for daily email and mild surfing. Not bad for $379, and with this, you do get what you pay for."
3.0,You get what you paid for,"I have a DELL that I bought in 2005 running XP.  It runs Office, Acrobat, Photoshop just fine but it is finally becoming hard to use online - warnings to update my browser, operating system, etc.  I paid $600 for it.  I paid only $350 for this last week.  How could I have gotten such a bargain?  Lower quality, poor performance out of the box is how.  Following the excellent advice here,  I bought an SSD drive and more memory.  Sure enough, out of the box this computer takes *forever* to boot.  With the upgrades, I am up and running in no time at all.  Just a bit faster than my DELL, and maybe 1/10 of the time it was before the upgrades.  I installed a 500GB WD SSD, and upgraded to 8GB of RAM.  The big difference was the SSD.  Created a Windows 10 installer on a USB stick in a half hour, and it took 5 minutes to install on the SSD.  You have to format the SSD and that is all.  Two dimples are visible in the bezel around the keyboard, from underneath, like a screw stanchion or something is pressing upwards.  Very cheap, I am afraid.  If you buy this, upgrade the hard drive to SSD or you will be sorry."
5.0,Love this laptop!,Amazing machine!  I purchased this after much research and I have to say I am very impressed!  Snappy response time compared to the old Toshiba that failed on me.  Camera picture quality is a little on the grainy side but everything else seems top-notch!  Great purchase!
5.0,Amazing Value!,"I did a tremendous amount of research before choosing this laptop and I definitely made the right choice. Right now it's the #1 laptop on Laptop.com for laptops under $500.  Powerful processor, 6 GB RAM, 1080p display, DVD drive, decent keyboard, outstanding battery life, smooth trackpad, 3 USB-3 and 1 USB-C port, wireless a/c, HDMI, the list goes on and on. It has an integrated Intel graphics card so only light gaming is possible. The memory and hard drives are easy to get to for upgrades. The only negative is  the included 1 TB 5400 RPM hard drive. As a boot drive it is horrible and really holds the performance of this machine back. I had a spare 2.5"" 240 GB SanDisk Ultra SSD laying around and swapped it in for the boot drive and that made a huge difference. There is an M.2 slot but it is NOT NVMe so make sure to buy the right drive for that slot. You're definitely going to want to upgrade the boot drive. One other caveat is the entire laptop is black including the keyboard so trying to type in a low light setting is tough for hunt and peck typing.  A back-lit keyboard would've been nice.  All in all, a great value and I highly recommend this laptop."
2.0,"If you are buying because it has a DVD player, DON'T!","It does not play DVD movies. Had to buy a external DVD player because I didn't feel like sending it back and waiting on return. It's a gift and the person I am sending it to does not internet. So trying to setup everything and purchase DVD software because Win10 does not come with the ability to play out of the box, I find out the player is not compatible to play DVD disc, unless they are burned disc. They should really tell you in description that it does not play DVD's. So if you have a library of DVD's and you want to buy this laptop, skip it."
5.0,Excellent laptop. Excellent price.,"An excellent computer at an excellent price. Plus, the Acer support for Amazon customers is very good. I'm still a Windows person, despite the trend to iOS. Yes, I use an iPhone, but I find iPADs totally inadequate for my purposes. I like a real keyboard and wasn't interested in investing in a Mac. Did a lot of research before I purchased this laptop from Amazon without feeling it and testing it and I am very happy with the purchase."
5.0,Really great laptop when you increase RAMs and use SSD as main drive,Just got the laptop and finished upgrading and configuring it.
1.0,"This Acer Laptop is a much lesser quality than had expected, read on!!!","First, specs claim 16gb DDR3L ram, only has 6gb ram."
5.0,Most of The Features For A Great Price,"I have to start by saying my last laptop was purchased in 2010 and for 5x as much as this one cost me. The battery and charger need to be replaced, but it was still nearly 15lbs when put together. A desktop replacement if anything."
5.0,Super comprehensive laptop for amazing price,"After getting used to this new laptop, trying a variety of tasks and of course playing my games I definitively approve.  I specifically did not want a touchscreen.  Fast startup and smooth running programs.  Easily syncing of my accounts (email, e.t.c) I have been able to basically pick right up.  I'm thoroughly pleased with my purchase especially after comparison shopping in store.  Twice the storage alone plus an extra 2G RAM for better gaming and this was a no brainer. I don't recommend playing games without being plugged in otherwise great battery"
5.0,LOVE My New Laptop!,"I read and read and read all the reviews, both negative and positive.  Decided to take a chance and so glad I did!  This is a great laptop, so much faster than my old one!  I got the  HDD, and it's plenty fast enough for my needs.  Setup was easy, getting everything the way I like it was easy too.  It did a lot of Windows Updates automatically, so that was good.  I definitely recommend the Acer Aspire Laptop!"
1.0,Extremely slow,"This is frankly the worst laptop I've ever owned. Sometimes upon opening my laptop and hitting the power button, nothing at all will happen. I try Ctrl alt del, I try esc, I try enter, I try hitting the power again - nothing. Sometimes it will show my desktop without icons or ability to login or a taskbar. Be I'll easily be there ten minutes trying to get it to let me sign in.  If I come back to it 20 min later, sometimes it's fine."
2.0,"A few concerns, Battery life is shorter than advertised & Poor USB location","There's a sticker on my laptop that says ""12 hrs Long battery life,"" this seems (too me) to be false advertising as the battery says 8+hrs while on battery saver mode and with the most conservative settings that I'm aware of.  The battery also did die well within 12 hrs of use after being fully charged."
4.0,It's not slow if...,"I read dozens of reviews of various laptops before deciding on this Acer.  The most common review complaint for just about all the laptops was that they are slow, sloow, slooow, as stated in reviews.  So the first thing I did was to delete all the junkware I considered unnecessary for my purposes then run a defrag to eliminate all the fragmentation from all the deletes.  The little Acer is now as fast as my desktop.  It opens and responds to my icons and apps quickly, both on and off line.  If it were any faster the speed would have to be measured in fractions of a second.  You do, however, need at least a 100 meg modem for that kind of on-line performance.  The four star rating is because the thing just ain't perfect.  We all have our little complaints about minor stuff that we have to accept."
5.0,Great value for money... Suprised me on games,I don't think there will be any better computer for the price that this one has... The value to cost is a done deal... I purchased this computer in hopes that it would run light games... Like rocket league e.c.t... The pc runs RL on 1366x768 with low settings at about 60-70fps...great fps for the price of the pc... The one down fall it has for gaming is the ddr3... The previous generation had ddr4 and because of that the integrated graphics ran a little faster... Thus producing better gaming performance... This isnt the best gaming pc out there... But for 380$ and light games... It works... I would totally recommend if you want a laptop to just have some fun with csgo and other light games or if you wana do a little bit if editing the i3-8130u is more than capable with its high boost speed... Great laptop for the price I will be buying another one for my brother soon... Btw good to add a ssd and ram
1.0,Absolutely the worst electronics buying have ever made.,Absolute piece of junk. Right out of the box into the ridiculous world of Windows 10.
5.0,Speakers are on the order of 300% better. Clear,"Similar to but much updated from my Toshiba laptop.  Speakers are on the order of 300% better.  Clear, loud and better bass (for a laptop)."
5.0,Great Linux Machine After Upgrades,I purchased this laptop and I happened to have 16GB of RAM to put in it and I did get an NVMe drive to put in it (yes it DOES support NVMe SSD/Intel Optane despite what Acer says here) the NVMe slot is x2 NOT the standard x4 so buying high end NVMe drives for this laptop would be a waste. The WD Blue 1TB NVMe drive does work great however and its top speed is only held back maybe 30% from being in x4 mode when I benched the drive in my desktop at x2 and x4 but that's only in benchmarks. I can still install Windows 10 on a VM located on this drive in about 12 minutes whether in x4 or x2 so real world difference is negligible but it can be felt over traditional SATA3 performance.
5.0,Excellent Value Budget Laptop,"The performance from this laptop is not actually bad, making it an excellent value. The construction is not particularly rugged, but as long as you pick it up with both hands, never by the screen, and use a cushioned backpack when transporting it, you should be fine."
4.0,"Working well, good buy for hte price.","Working great and I am typing on it atm. The only problem is that it is not a good enough computer to run a complex game such as World of warcraft. However, it does amazon and school websites so it does suit it's purpose for now. I really can't complain becauase it is a good computer for the price paid."
4.0,"Good laptop for the cost, with a couple tweaks","I started the laptop up right when I got it to get a sense of out-of-the-box speed and the state of the Windows 10 OS.  Not great on either front, as you'd expect."
1.0,"Unreliable screen: Suspending or Locking the laptop, causes the screen go black and not turn back on","The laptop is good for daily use. It is a bit slow but I am going to disregard that as a factor in this review. My only problem is that occasionally when I suspend or lock the laptop or even leave it idle and the screen goes black, it does not come back on. I'm not sure if the system hangs or that there is some issue with the screen. To test this I installed Fedora (dual boot) to see if it happens on Fedora as well and it did. So I'm sure that the problem is not with any software, OS or drivers. To recover from this, I just have to do a hard reboot (on both Windows and Linux). And this is a pain as I am sometimes in the middle of work."
5.0,but I loved how easy it was to set up,"I've just had this for 2 days, but I loved how easy it was to set up.  Didn't take hours for Windows to load, and didn't have a lot of unnecessary junk that my previous HP loaded onto it. I only use it for web browsing & video streaming, and I'm very happy with both the speed & quality of both.  The only complaint I have sof far is that there's no way to see if your Caps or Num locks are on."
5.0,A Great Buy!,"I am usually an HP person when it comes to buying desktop and laptop computers. However, when my presence HP rapidly began to succumb to hardware failure, I found that I had to act fast or risk losing seven years of data.  So I looked around at several places and online stores until I stumbled upon this Acer Aspire E 15 at the end of the year sale section on Amazon, which has everything or more of what I was looking for in a laptop. As described it is a 15.6"" Full HD, 8th Gen Intel Core i3-8130U, 6GB RAM Memory, 1TB HDD, 8X DVD, E5-576. It also came with Windows 10 and not much else, which is fine with me as I like adding my own programs."
5.0,Get more than you pay for,"Like most non-gamer adults, I use this computer for very average things. Storing photos, surfing the web, checking email, the occasional Word Doc and Excel File, and a DVD video here and there. It doesn't really take a lot of computer to execute those kinds of tasks, hence I didn't see any need to go spend $1000 on a computer to do things that a computer half that price should be able to do. Couple that with the fact that I prefer to keep my money in my bank account rather than spending it, and I thought I'd give this Acer a try. My previous computer was an Acer Aspire laptop, that going on 10 years old is still working, it's just so slow that I figured it was time to move on."
5.0,Performance is great for price,"This is amazing for the price, it can play games and get well playable fps. For example it plays fortnite pretty well. This is a great laptop."
4.0,Great laptop,"I have given this laptop a fair chance.  To start off, I absolutely love it. I am no computer pro so the first 4+ months I couldn't use this laptop because it was SLOW. Unusable slow.  It turns out that it's because of all the bloat on it.  I did some research and decided to dedicate a little time to looking up each program to delete. Once i got enough off, this laptop was FAST! I haven't had any issues with it since.  I love it!  I upload pictures to my drive with it easily and use it for internet along with Word. It isn't as bright as some laptops, kind of a washed out screen but it isn't bad.  It is well worth what I paid for it.  Make sure you put some work into getting the bloat off and you'll love it!"
5.0,Glad,"Made glad by all the bells and whistles on this Windows device. Not the fastest processor but the price was great and made my own memory & SSD upgrade with ease.  The company support was better than average...no wait, far better than average as I recall the last time I dealt with PCs there was little to no response to the customer. Acer has it and helped although it was a bit hard to find that help at first,  but once gotten they made it a breeze."
5.0,Overall thoughts on this laptop.,This is the best laptop for light or a decent amount of gaming. It runs pretty quick for its price and most likely the best outcome for the money spent.
2.0,Not a simple process unless you are computer tech,"I bought the recommended 250gb WD Blue SSD upgrade only to find out it's not compatible with the computer supposedly again the 500gb same brand is,  Acer You need to fix that!!  Big waste of time, installing only to find It didn't work, searched several websites, to learn ya it's not compatible, unless you are an IT person and can download windows 10 onto an external drive create a virtual blah blah blah, I was goijng to buy additional RAM but am afraid to now as will it work, who knows.I  am not able to connect external Monitor even though its an Acer Monitor,  screen goes black and all the guidance is super. complicated again to fix.  I have watched lots of videos on doing the upgrades., which are great if you are basically super tech savvy.  All the video's seem to leave out key navigation steps.  So they are useless to me.  I am going to have to now pay someone to do all of these supposedly basics things to the computer.  I am not afraid to tackle challenges and I am really good at figuring out solutions,  but when it comes to this computer model its been a bust all the way around.  And lets face it, It's a pretty cheap  computer, yes but all the claims of being easy to upgrade DIY is a lie, unless you know how to build and upgrade, and setup computers."
4.0,Decent PC for price really good deal but need to remove junk software,A lot of the slowness of this laptop is not Acer's fault but Windows 10. The first thing you need to do is go into Services and turn off almost everything that is not absolutely everything - not set to automatic but rather to manual. Then uninstall all the crap software you don't need. And absolutely turn off background Windows 10 search indexing. Once you get all this done it will perform very decently as a casual use laptop.
1.0,Worst laptop ever - AVOID,This is literally the worst laptop purchase I have ever made. Let me just list the issues I've had with this so hopefully someone else can avoid:
5.0,Great Budget Notebook,"I have an old Compaq CQ57 that I purchased in August 2012.  I am on a budget and had to buy a cheap notebook.  When I got this Acer, I was impressed with the quality compared to my old notebook.  I purchased a Western Digital SSD with this notebook and installing is easy.  Just download the Microsoft Media Tool on a flash drive of at least 8 GB and start the notebook with the flash drive.  After Windows 10 is installed to the SSD, there is a big difference in startup from the Compaq."
5.0,The best computer I've ever owned,"When I was looking for a new laptop, I needed something that was fast, had plenty of storage, and could run Sims 4. The size of this computer, while intimidating at first, has since proved to be perfect for me. I love the 1080p resolution, and I'll never have to worry about storage ever again. I was a bit apprehensive as to whether it would play Sims 4, mostly because I've never purchased a computer for myself, but since receiving the Acer E 15 I've now created and destroyed many virtual families. Not only does Sims 4 run perfectly, including mods and expansions, but I have finally been able to return from my 7+ year World of Warcraft hiatus. I finally have a computer that can play both of my favorite games so smoothly and I still can't believe I only paid $350 for this beauty. Don't bother paying extra for shipping because I didn't and it showed up in two days anyway."
4.0,Great Value for the Money,"I am not a ""techy"" that knows a lot about the various specifications but I did my research on this and I think it is an excellent computer for under $400.  The screen may not be that vibrant  but after the first week or I don't notice it.  Quite fast, and I like the 1TB hard drive.  I do mostly text editing and audio functions and everything is working fine.  I loaded iTunes recently and it works just fine, too.  Good find for the money, good job, Acer!"
4.0,Very good price for what you get.  Worth buying for sure.,Loved it at first but in short order became quite slow.  Don't know why.  Don't play games on it.  Just work or watching Netflix occasionally. Battery life is almost as advertised.  I'm sure it would be if not used for streaming video.
2.0,Battery Life Manufacturer False Advertising,"Purchased an  Acer Aspire E 15, 15.6"" 3 months ago. Main reason I purchased this computer was the advertised battery life of up to 13 hours. Sure if you do not use the computer the battery will last 13 hours or more. However battery life for normal use is less than 3 hours. Contacted tech support twice and I was told my browser is using too much power. Really???? I am suppose to believe that?? I requested a replacement battery and my request was refused. I was told I needed to mail my computer to a out of state repair facility. After some verbal arm twisting the rep finally agreed to provide a return label for repair. Label was never sent. Before you spend your hard earned money on an Acer product my advice is buy a different brand. Battery issues with Acer computers are a common discussion on the internet. It takes less than 5 minutes to replace the defective battery, but Acer wants me to wait weeks for a repair?"
1.0,Acer support team is not good and can’t fix easy to fix issues with computer.,The computer is very slow in general since it isn’t an SSD. Worked quickly once I installed a SSD and moved the OS to it.
1.0,EXCRUCIATINGLY SLOW AND ABYSMAL SUPPORT,"This is the slowest PC I've ever seen in 25 years of using them.  It is so painfully slow that I wanted to install an SSD.  First step is to remove the battery, right?  Should be covered in the user manual, right? WRONG!!  and absolutely nothing available on the internet for this model either.  OK, so I contacted Acer support, and that's where I learned how really stupid I was to ever buy an Acer product.  Even after I provided all details (model number, serial number, etc) they refused to answer the basic question of how to remove the battery unless I gave them my address, my email address, my cell phone number, my social security number, and the names and addresses of all of my children, grandchildren, and business associates (and that is only a slight exaggeration).  Never again, Acer.  and please stop calling your lack of response ""customer support"" -- it is nothing of the kind."
1.0,Better to get a different laptop,"There are better laptaps on the market, I've had to restart the laptop several times to work and sound will not play via the speakers.  I would elaborate but I'm just tired of wasting time on this laptop."
4.0,Hard Drive Died in less than a Year,"The hard drive died after 11 months.  It was broken so badly that I had to remove it before I could get the system to boot from a USB drive .  Be warned, create an external backup.  I lost my Windows 10 OS and all my files.  Up until this failure, this was an excellent cheap laptop.  ... Later update after installing an SSD...  I'm adding two stars back because this laptop was so easy to upgrade.  Remove three screws and you can lift the access door off with your hands.  Once inside all the memory and drive slots are easy to get to.  If you search for the model number, E5-576-392H, online you will find videos on how to upgrade the drives and memory.  Be sure to look inside your laptop before you order parts.  There are different variants of this model.  Not all of them have the install screw required for the tiny form factor SSD."
4.0,Needs modification,"I followed instructions on some of the very helpful reviews and purchased a 250 ssd. It was actually a linked optional item when I selected the laptop. So that made it easy to pick the right specs as I'm really not that good with computer hardware. I installed the ssd, made a windows 10 boot media on a USB drive using this same laptop and went through the initial setup ( i didn't have another computer to use ), then rebooted the computer, changing the BIOS to boot from USB, loaded windows 10 to the ssd, then ran msconfig to delete the 1T original hard drive from the boot option, thought I was all set. Then I realize my browser was loading rediculously slowly, way way slower than any of my devices. So I searched online and found that there was a compatibility issue of the new wifi technology with my 7 year old Verizon fios router. This is what I had to do:"
4.0,More Easy Upgrade Info - just some additional details,Others have done a thorough job detailing the SSD upgrade. Here are my notes as well. Hope they help:
3.0,Not entirely upgradeable,"Overall, with my installed upgrades the Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H/i3-8130U is a decent computer; I installed 16GB RAM & the WD 250GB SSD - Unfortunately the BIOS is locked; The SSD drive could not be designated as the primary drive nor could it be identified or used as a secondary drive with the 1TB HHD drive or with a SSD in the primary drive slot. All this effort was done by the GEEK squad; I talked with ACER Techs & they confirmed it's locked on a single HHD/SSD; If i had known i would have bought a different computer - i returned the 250 SSD & had a 500GB SSD installed to replace the 1TB HHD as a single memory drive -"
1.0,Dead pixel out of the box,Dead pixel out of the box
4.0,Awesome laptop for the price.,"Considering the price of this laptop, it's hard to ask for more."
4.0,Little upgrades make it an EXCELLENT machine,"1st thing 1st -- Price fluctuations: as of 3.18.19, the prices has moved from a high of $379.99, to $329.99 on Black Friday, 2018, to a mid range price (that I bought at, of $349.99)."
5.0,"Great product, work computer, amazing customer service","I purchased this laptop because it is relatively inexpensive but still had a bit of power behind it.  I use it for work and school.  A great nod to customer service, the first one was just about DOA.  Turned it on and screen went black,  called the HP help and they were amazing.  I am fairly computer savvy but knew I needed to call because it was brand new before I cracked into it.  After an hour on the phone the wonderful IT help told me it was likely something they needed to fix in their factory and told me how to return it.  The next one arrived with no problems.  They are well made because I recently dropped about 4oz of water on the keyboard, because I dunno,  I immediately turned it off, opened it up, flipped it over and opened the back.  It has had no problems after 24 hours of dry time because they put a spill guard under the keyboard that once flipped over and opened like a V the water runs down this rather than into the electronics.  Thank you HP for your customer service and making a well made product for just a few hundred bucks."
4.0,Good computer.,"Good, strong basic computer.  Have several."
1.0,Slowest computer since dial up,"There must have been something wrong with the one I got. It was super slow and wouldn't even play a utube video. I checked my speed and connections with another laptop and my speeds were good. I tried to load Chrome to see if that would help and even stopwatched the time and after 10 minutes of trying to download Chrome I decided to return it since my other laptop had no connection problems and my download speeds were good. It was a big hassle overall packing it up and returning it, not to mention a couple hours making sure it was truly defective before returning it.....not too happy."
5.0,The best laptop pc!!!!!!,I have been reading the reviews for this item. Some negative and some positive. My review is positive. This item is built great fast and amazing. I have a high end desktop and need some thing portable but not to break the bank. This is a budget pc but it is amazing. Two thumbs up.
4.0,Great so far!,I waited two weeks before posting a review because I wanted to answer questions I myself had before buying this laptop. I should first say that I am in no way a computer expert. This review is from the perspective of a normal user with little to no background in tech.
4.0,Good laptop for the price.,"This is a real good laptop for the price, just over $300. Bootup is typical for a Windows 10 machine, not fast but not especially slow. I have encountered no problems with setup or use so far."
5.0,Works great for my needs  :),I needed a Windows computer to do random things. I’m a iPhone user and my home is pretty much set up to run Apple products. But every now and then something isn’t Apple compatible and I need Windows. This computer checked all the boxes for what I needed and it’s been working great.
4.0,This can be an easy 5 star budget laptop with a couple upgrades.,"I needed a replacement for my old Thinkpad that I rebuilt. 90% of use for this laptop will be coding in HTML, CSS, JS and C#/.NET. Out of the box this laptop is a little slow. Like others, it is highly recommended to install an M.2 SSD and upgrade the ram. Fortunately, Acer has made this a semi modular laptop with an easy access to the hard drive, RAM and M.2 slot. Reinstall Windows on the SSD ASAP and your boot time will increase by a significant amount. This laptop comes with a 4GB and a 2GB sticks of RAM. I ordered a 4GB stick and swapped it with the 2GB and now have 8GB of dual channel RAM. These simple upgrades turn this low end laptop to a mid ranged laptop."
5.0,"Nice, quick, affordable PC","Light weight, fast, decent display screen although not glass. Fast easy setup. No real complaints. Nice unit for the price. I would buy again."
4.0,A few Problems at the start,"I had difficulty in getting this PC up and running correctly.  Right out of the box I was getting error messages, and it would freeze up.  It wouldn't shut down properly, and I was ready to send it back.  I had contacted Amazon to get a return tag, then the GREAT people at Amazon asked if they could possibly help me and determine the problems.  I was given the steps to disable some windows options, and after completing those steps, it has worked as it should.  I was disappointed"
3.0,Not a good choice to switch from a 10 year old Macbook Pro,"I purchased this with the intention of replacing my 2009 Macbook Pro. I do use a desktop PC at work (running Windows 7 - not Windows 10), so I use both Mac OS & Windows daily. The main problem that I had with the Acer is that the configuration seems incredibly slow to me. I even purchased a SSD & more ram but decided that I would return the machine and the upgrades without opening the bottom."
5.0,Terrific Value,Very Excellent. Bought it for Mom. She was able to set it up herself. Get online and go!
3.0,"Not a bad laptop, but I would not get it if you don't want to upgrade any parts","Its not bad for its price especially if you get it on sale, but if you don't want to upgrade any parts then I would not recommend getting this laptop. The laptop is very very slow without any upgrades. The 5400 rpm hard drive is outdated and incredibly slow. The laptop does have a m2 slot so upgrading to an ssd is highly recommended. The 6gb ram comes in 2 slots. One 2gb and one 4gb. This is another aspect you should upgrade otherwise you will not be able to take advantage of dual channel. Lastly you HAVE to upgrade the wifi card. The wifi card is incredibly slow."
2.0,I should have purchased a different laptop.,"I bought this one for home use. Email, surfing and paying bills. Normal stuff. I have had it for 6 months and now I can give it a decent review. I am comparing this to our Lenovo laptop. It takes about twice as long for this one to load up from power off. Once it wakes up most things are easy to do. Like I said , home use. I call Acer at least once a month for issues. Some of them have to do with how slow it is. Others have to do with things like, wont print when I tell it to. I tried printing a document from my email and got only the first sheet. More times than one, only the first sheet. The Lenovo, no problems. Same email, same document. The latest is trying to get my phone pictures downloaded. I have called Acer several times about it. Updated my windows, changed phone cables, and on and on. Acer said it was probably the phone. Yea right. Connected it to the Lenovo, it downloaded all the photos,and put them in folders, under the photo app. Acer couldn't make theirs do that. I am past the return date, so I have to keep it or it would go back. My advice is to spend $150.00 more dollars and get one that doesn't drive you crazy with how it doesn't work like others do."
4.0,Best bang for buck in low-to-mid range laptop!,"Good laptop for the price! Comes with a little bit of bloatware, but I've seen much worse from other manufacturers. **** Important: HDD was 30% fragmented upon arrival; hence, it was running fairly sluggish at first. Run disk defragment to fix this (you can use Cortana to search defragment, but Acer also has its own utility).**** After taking off the little bit of bloatware it came with (including Norton) and running disk defragment, it has fairly quick speed/response and tons of free space. Could easily run something like Minecraft off this, but it's intended for leisure/everyday/school/office work; not gaming."
4.0,Very Solid Bang for your BUCK,"This laptop isn't as fast as my work laptop, but what do I expect from an i3 vs. i8 processor?  i3 Coffee Lake processor is better than shelling out for an i5 processor; and gets the job done so far for being my school laptop.  It's kinda bulky though and the mouse track sucks.  Get a wireless mouse for that, and upgrade to an SSD with more RAM when you can.  Be careful though if carrying in a bookbag laptop component, as one side is plastic vents that may break on impact if that is the side facing downwards in your bag."
1.0,CRAPPY INTERNET,Excited over getting my wife a new laptop but it was a horrible mistake. She set it up and then it didn't want to load any internet pages and stalled out several times. Did a factory reset and still acted up. Called tech support and got told it would be best to send it back to Amazon and get a different computer. Not sure I want to get her the same computer. Hope the next one works better.
1.0,"Slow, froze, and had to return!",The good - Set up was very easy!  Now the bad - It would take 5 minutes+ boot up. VERY VERY SLOW.. Then it started to freeze up constantly. I had to keep rebooting the system only to have it freeze on a blue screen. Must have spent 2 days trying to fix it. Reset to factory settings and tried again only to have it happen again. I was only using the laptop to surf the web and check emails. The only software downloaded was windows updates and Norton thru my internet provider.  Had the system a month. Sent back for a refund. I was lucky I had this problem while I was still able to return it. Amazon was fantastic about returning it and refunded me promptly.
4.0,Nothing Beats It on the Price Range,"Great Machine, with great value for dollar, the screen is solid and also the keyboard, the connectors on the sides are a good mix and the inclusion of a Graphics Card cant be beaten for anything else, however, you have to keep in mind that The 250 GB SSD wont be enough for productivity or school work on it's own, and the installation of a HDD although possible can result a lit bit annoying."
4.0,Great after some upgrades,"Straight from the box it works fine.  Not a lot of bloatware, only the Notron antivirus and Microsoft Office trials.  After reading some other reviews, I did what was suggested for upgrades.  I replaced the RAM to 16GB and added a 500GB NAND SSD and put the OS on the SSD.  These minor upgrades significantly reduced boot up time and increased application performance.  I don't do much gaming on the machine, primarily movies and Office programs.  The battery lasts about 5 hours if I'm watching movies from the hard drive, I haven't watched one from the DVD drive, but would imagine battery life would be significantly diminished due to the power required to run the drive."
5.0,"6gb of ram is good but for performance and gaming, at least 8gb of ram is needed.","There's a lot of things I love about this computer, from the fact that it can be used to play some heavy games but can defintely play games, from Realm Royale to Paladins to Dota 2 this computer can handle it, the battery life is amazing, from gaming to watching netflix, it can last a lifetime, the amazing 1920x1080 display helps look a photos and videos amazing, the 1TB storage allows me to have hundreds of games and photos, the i3 (though it isn't a i5 or i7 or i9) can still prove to be powerful,  especially the 8th generation cpu, it can handle lots of processes at once, the only bad thing about this computer is 6gb of ram but luckily can be upgraded to 16gbs of ram."
5.0,Very good product for the price,We needed a new laptop because of insufficient memory in our previous unit. With a terabite of storage this machine does the job. No touch screen and not the latest Intel chips but more than adequate for the price.
3.0,Its okay.,"I bought this laptop to use in college since I am mainly putting most of my budget into my PC gaming/work station setup. If you're in a similar situation where you just wanted a cheap laptop that would work things like google docs, Microsoft office, YouTube, etc. and DIDN'T want to get a crappy Chromebook then this product might be worth looking into. However it is defiantly at the bottom of the barrel for laptops for people looking to get the most out of one. The performance is fine for $400 but really lacking compared to most of whats out there. If you just need a supplemental piece of hardware to access your school or work website and take notes in class then its great but if you want to really use it for productivity and under more strenuous circumstances then defiantly invest another $200 into something with better parts, better specs, and better performance."
5.0,"A little slower than my i7 Asus, but great product for the money","I love this laptop. I have to be a little more patient as it runs slower than my better i7 Asus, but it got broken in a car accident and I needed something fast and cheap. Found this and I love it. The body is plastic as opposed to the aluminum of the ASUS so I'm slightly afraid I'll break it as I'm typically rough on things. But with care and a lot of padding in a case while traveling to coffee shops to do my work I'm hoping it will last a while. I wish it had backlit keys, but you can't give everything for so little cost. There's no Microsoft product installed, you will have to purchase separately but there is wordpad, so I use that if I need to. I haven't watched movies on it so I can't comment on that yet but overall, I feel like it is a great product for the money"
1.0,The screen makes it hard on the eyes,I think there is something wrong with the screen on this laptop - it’s washed out and you can’t really see the colors properly. I literally just got it and have spent most of my time trying to adjust the screen to something more tolerable. I don’t think this is something that can be adjusted. What I mean is...it’s hard to look at the screen on the laptop. The laptop isn’t broken...it just has a terrible screen on it which makes it hard on the eyes.
4.0,Perfectly competent machine,"Deserves a 9 out of 10, maybe even a 95 out of 100, but not a 5 out of 5.  It does everything we needed the machine to do: surf internet, basic coding, some drawing, some gaming, etc.  It's a well rounded machine.  Portable, durable: it's lived in my son's bookbag and taken 3 months of trips back and forth to school."
1.0,Don't Recommend - Go with a different brand for you cheap laptop needs.,"Needed a cheap computer with long battery life for a class I was taking, since the class didn't have outlets.  Didn't ask for much from it, just basic MS Office and internet access.  This laptop barely delivered, but the battery has lasted 5+ hrs per charge so far, which was my main need."
1.0,Keys are switched,i bought this laptop for my sister. she found out the keys Z and Y are switched and keyboard is not working normally. is there a patch we need to download to correct this? Otherwise we have to return this hunk of junk.
1.0,Worst Computer I've Ever Owned,"Everything bad about this computer has been said in all of the other one star reviews.  Videos, browser, files, apps all lock up.  It takes 15 minutes to boot up.  It doesn't always connect to WiFi at boot up."
5.0,After Upgrading It's supper fast!,"Not a Touch Screen Thankfully! Pulled the I TB hard drive put in 2TB SSD Card, Removed the Ram Chips and used 16GB set. Now connected to 1 Gig Fiber Optic network and truly amazed with speeds!"
5.0,Price and Performance,"The price sealed the deal.  Screen and construction are quality, and the keyboard size and layout work well for us.  We installed larger capacity RAM and a SSD for the OS.  This thing boots up in less than 30 seconds and runs anything we throw at it without loss of processing speed.  If only ACER offered a small ""docking station"".  Then we would never buy another desktop PC again."
