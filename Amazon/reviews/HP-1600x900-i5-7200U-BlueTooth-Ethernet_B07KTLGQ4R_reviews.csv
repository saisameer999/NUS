1.0,Can not connect to  5GHZ internet connections,"Bought this computer and was surprised that I could not connect to the internet at 5GHZ. If I would have known that, I would not have bought it."
4.0,Good for school and small business.,I like the being able to talk to it and tell it what to do.
5.0,Thank God for Amazon.,My computer died and I needed to find another at a reasonable price.
5.0,Perfect for me,"I like the size of the screen, the weight of this laptop and the number pad on the right...just about everything!"
5.0,Great choice for me,"I purchased this laptop to replace my old one (almost 9 years old when it bit the dust). It has exceeded all my hopes, and it does everything I need and more.  Easy to get it up and running."
1.0,Disappointing Product,This unit failed after one week. I called the service line provided for assistance and I was told it would cost me $49.00. I returned the unit for a full refund and am very dissatisfied.
5.0,HP has always been a great product,"HP 17"" laptop is everything that was said about it.  Ease of Start up. Ease of adding apps.  I even upgraded the Windows 10 Home that came with it to Windows 10 Pro and got great results.  Highly recommend the this Laptop."
3.0,Not Impressed,"First impressions are that this is poorly built. Seems very flimsy, compared to my previous HP. I would sooner have a well built computer that weighs a little more, than a lightweight flimsy model. I was hoping that it would be super fast, but I am not impressed with the speed. Main reason to buy a new computer was to play a game. This computer crashes approximately every 3 hours of play, even though the computer exceeds the recommended specs for the game."
5.0,Excellant value!,Very pleased with this purchase. It was as advertised.
5.0,Exactly as expected!,"The packaging was well-designed and easy to unbox. The laptop was pristine and the battery lasts and lasts. Since this was a gift I can't really comment on the performance or speed, but my niece is thrilled with it!"
