5.0,"Excellent value for a $249 laptop, compares nicely to HP Stream 14", Video review posting soon!
4.0,A very solid laptop for the price.,"This laptop is a great buy that fits nicely between ""cheap"" and ""too cheap"". You're obviously not going to be playing graphics intensive games on this. That's not what it's for. If you're looking for a solid internet/email/office apps laptop that is light weight, has decent battery life, is surprisingly speedy, and is cheap, this is it."
5.0,Great little computer for the price!!,"I haven't owned a new laptop since I bought my Asus 6 years ago. I am comparing this little gem with that monster. This is smaller and lighter. The battery life so far much surpasses what I was used to. This Acer has a much more user-friendly keypad and touchpad, and the display and sound are much improved as well. The internet speed is faster and the response to new tasks is quick. The set-up was pretty easy. Nice to have Office included for the first year, therefore saving $60+ out of the gate. I was used to Windows 10 and the s mode does not seem to be a problem as I just use Edge to access what I need without downloading the apps, ie google photos, etc. I did not need anything with bells and whistles and therefore did not want to spend a lot of money - just something better for word processing, social media, emailing, etc. That is exactly what I found."
1.0,NEVER AGAIN - JUST 60GB STORAGE and HORRIBLE technical support.,"This laptop only has 60GB of storage. That is awfully low. Keep that in mind b-4 buying. Also keep in mind that Acer tech support is HORRIBLE. I could not plug my HDMI cable into my Acer laptop HDMI port.  I had received a document from Amazon with a phone number for 24/7 Acer tech support exclusive for Amazon customers. I called five times. Three times I was disconnected. One time, the incompetent Acer rep told me my laptop had no HDMI connected. When I read to her the specs, she hung up. The next Acer rep told me to send in the computer (brand new) for repair."
5.0,This is why it’s good,"For around $250, this thing is worth it. I’m running an el gato game capture card on it that’s recording gameplay, I have multiple tabs open, playing music on YouTube from one of them, and I’m downloading mp4 from the game capture all at once. It’s not slowing down or lagging at all right now. I approve."
4.0,Very Basic student laptop with eMMC chip and only 40GB free storage,"If you are in the market for a laptop for basic surfing and email needs (which most phones can do), or for mostly word processing, then this device may be a good option for you. Anything beyond that may end with you quickly running into issues with storage space and speed."
2.0,"Still waiting a week later,fail on next day delivery. Good laptop","One week after ordering, the laptop still isn't here.  I'd selected next day delivery because it was important I receive the laptop ASAP.  After calling Amazon they did give me a $10 credit, which is the only reason this doesn't get one star.  It wasn't until the 3rd call several days later that I got a shipment date.  This WAS a good deal, but the delay and loss in productivity cost me much more than $10.  If you NEED something fast, get it at a real store, don't rely on Amazon shipping to get it there or for Amazon to offer fair compensation for delays.  Their policy is fine for socks and stuff, but not for anything work related.  The price of $200 WAS good, if only it would finally get here."
1.0,Laptop freezing,"Hi I  got my laptop on Saturday and I set it up but now and then it freeze, is this a new computer"
5.0,MS Office One Year Include,"I love it ,Even I don't really need it any more but I decided to keep it ...Very Thin with Smooth Looking , MSOffice  One Year"
1.0,"This cheap!y made thing sucks, big time!","This thing is not used friendly!  Email does not work.  The screen is flooded with adds selling updates.  Seems like a shopping device for Microsoft software more than a computer.  I hope Acer reads this review.  The right and left click works sometimes.  My opinion of Amazon is starting to deminish.  I wanted a computer to do simple tasks.  Due to my lack of a computer engineering degree, this was not it!  I can't give this product anything more than 1 star and that is because there's no 0 box to check.  How can they get by with selling something this awful?"
5.0,Good for what it is.,"This review is for the Acer A114-32-C1YA.  64gb of storage, 4gb of RAM, Windows S."
5.0,Excellent for the price,"You get what you pay for! I think this is value for money. It’s not built like a tank, it’s plastic but if you are someone that takes care of your things, it lasts just as well. Very good screen resolution and set up is very simple. So far I’ve had no problems with it at all and it does everything I need it to do. I’m not a gaming person at all so this handles everything else very well at a fraction of the cost. I suppose it depends what you need it for. Highly recommended for a low budget computer. If I were to rate it according to those in its class - there would be five stars throughout."
1.0,Died after two days of use,The computer seemed ok when we first opened the package(Christmas gift for my wife).  Started up fine.  Had no issues during use of day 1.  Next day my wife told me the computer just turned off on her.  I checked it out and it would not turn on.  The power on light would come on but the screen would not.  I disconnected power and held the battery disconnect button as this does not have a removable battery.  The computer then turned back on once I reattached power.  I was in the middle of typing something at the start menu and then the screen went black again.  I tried the same procedure but this time the power light would come on briefly then turn off.  First and last Acer in my house.
4.0,Excellent for the price,"Only two complaints about this notebook, battery can run down fairly quickly and my main gripe touch pad is a little wonky. I ended up going with a wireless mouse. Keep it plugged in when not on the go and use a mouse and it's a great budget notebook at the price. Good screen display pretty light weight and keyboard is fine."
4.0,The 'Good Enough' Laptop,"The Acer Aspire 1 is the Microsoft answer to the continuing onslaught of affordable Google Chromebooks, featuring decent specs, at a downright affordable price. While I would not want to use it as my only machine, as a secondary device, it has much to offer."
5.0,It works so well your kid will turn into a steamed vegetable.,"I guess it works well. I got it for my 15 year-old daughter, as she was often panicked and losing her mind with last minute word-processing issues and printing needs at 11:00 pm the night before they were due.  The idea was I could sleep.  Maybe."
3.0,Read entire description!,"Build quality seems good. Product description a little misleading. We were comparing a few other budget laptops. This one seemed to be the best value according to RAM and Processor speed. The specs listed this unit as 2.6GHz, however when we unboxed and  checked the actual processor speed it registers as 1.1GHz. After some online investigation I found that the Intel Celeron N4000 has the ability to 'turbo-boost' to 2.6GHz, but only for a short period if time until it eventually thermo-throttles back down to 1.1GHz. Not an absolute deal breaker, but I do feel like they should explain that in better detail in the product description."
1.0,BUYER BEWARE,"I just wanted an extra windows laptop for light inet browsing and Microsoft office work, and I didn't want to spend more than 300$. I went through set-up and then it shut off. It tried to reboot itself 3 times before it started. I wanted to give it a chance, I knew it was going to be a cheap laptop - not just price-point wise, like I knew I wasn't getting a quality laptop, and hey, maybe it just needed a little extra time to get going.. (? that's me not wanting to have to deal with returning the thing I guess), but then it shut off AGAIN. So yes, hadn't even owned it 5 minutes and it shut down on me 4 times. Maybe I got a lemon?"
4.0,Great PC for a Student,"I have a middle-school aged child and as he gets older, more of his school assignments are done online.  He needs the computer more and more to write papers or hand in assignments in his school portal.  After reading reviews for SEVERAL laptops, I decided to take a chance on this one as the reviews were good and the product description was exactly what I needed."
4.0,First thing you need to do is switch out of windows s mode,Solid laptop. Users...first thing you need to google and do is to take this product out of Windows S mode
3.0,Windows 10 S is AWFUL!,There are some good things about this laptop:
5.0,Good value,"I got this in January and have been using it as my main computer ever since. It's primarily aimed at browsing the net, email, etc. If you want to do heavy-duty computing like serious animated gaming, or video editing, etc., this probably won't meet your needs, but for what it does, it's great. And it's very light (partly because it doesn't have a DVD drive) and it's actually comfortable on your lap, unlike my previous computer (a Dell) which now feels like a brick in my lap. And it's silent and fanless and seems to run cool.  I'm often baffled by my friends who buy thousand-dollar computers and just use them for email and watching cat videos and the occasional Word file. If that's what you use a computer for, you can't beat this value."
5.0,What more can a teen as for?,"My 15 year old uses this laptop day and night. She uses it without the charger cable and doesn't complain about the battery life. She leaves it on her bed and it doesn't over heat, which was my #1 fear. I've witness for myself the what a hot laptop can do to a bed (fire). The quality of video are superb and it been dropped at least once and no cracks and dents. It was also inexpensive and useful for her school and social life. It's cool as she puts it an it's great to me."
4.0,Great starter/light use laptop.,I've used this for a few days now;
5.0,Excellent for the price point,"It is an excellent laptop for the price point (for $229) . It is a real laptop, not a Chromebook, which is what I was looking for. The 64gb give you enough internal space to store some data and having some APPs installed - it is of course limiting, but a lot of low priced laptops come with 32gb, which is just a no go."
4.0,A decent machine for the cost,"Windows 10 doesn't seem all that great.  I upgraded from a previous Aspire that was getting crunched for memory.  This one has a lot more memory, but  far too much is taken by windows and some of the apps.  Junk accumulates much too fast.  Size-wise I liked my older one, but maybe I will get used to this bigger size (and heavier)"
5.0,Acer and Amazon do it again!,"This machine replaces an earlier Aspire I purchased in 2013, it performs perfectly and has a brilliant screen. My last one didn't have any other issue than low memory and smaller screen.....new programs require more DRAM and HD memory to function at speeds equivalent to my desktop. The form and function are superior on this Aspire, it's very light and the brushed black finish virtually eliminates fingerprints. I cannot imagine how they produce sell and ship this laptop for anywhere near the price......great job Acer and Amazon!"
4.0,Love the Old School Matte Display,"Great for every day use - surfing web, watching Netflix and creating PowerPoint presentations. It's one of the few remaining ""matte display"" laptops which I prefer. If you don't like the glossy and highly reflective screens found on most laptops today, you may prefer this machine and its screen."
5.0,Good for the price,Seems to operate very well
2.0,performance - this thing is slow - trust me you don't want it,I have had ACER's 5 to be exact - I think this thing is slower than my first one way back in Windows 98SE days.
5.0,The price,"This is very good computer for its budget price, good screen nice bult quality i bought this for someone else but the use is unique for people who has business like work on the office, normal daily tasks, read emails, watch YouTube or netflix, sorry for gamers because this is not intended for that, but if you are in college and need a good laptop you got a good one in here"
5.0,Best compuyer I have ever owned.,It is thin and is light weight. Stays cool when used on my lap. Most laptops get hot. I am still learning how to use the many features. Using it is very enjoyable. I can't put it down. The screen is very clear and detailed. The built in speakers are clear and work better than any others I have heard.
5.0,Worth it,"The quality of the laptop for the price is pretty amazing.  Good screen resolution, good weight, good speed for general use, all things considered, perfect student laptop."
5.0,Good student laptop,"Good unit, mouse pad a bit insensitive even after calibration. Works well with external mouse. Holds up to academic use and travel"
4.0,Good buy,"No touch screen, pretty fast and very responsive, easy to use and long battery life."
1.0,Failed Birthday Gift,"Got this for my 12 year olds birthday. After set up, the screen stayed black after logging into the computer. Same day it was received. Returning."
4.0,Good value for money,"This is a good product. Fairly decent value for money. Reasonably fast. Only downside is the display which is poor quality. It's 1080p but colors look faded. It ships with Windows 10 s mode, which restricts you to use software from Windows app store only. But this can be overridden and Windows Can be upgraded to Windows 10 home for free. Storage is limited but can be increased with a micro SD card. Over all a good product."
3.0,"Inital impression: good, but trackpad has an issue","The trackpad has a slight amount of play, or looseness before registering a pressure click.  This can be felt when just moving the pointer around and is fairly annoying.  I don't know if this is normal or if I should send it back for replacement or repair."
1.0,Display card defective. Screen broken in less than a week.,"Very disappointed. I bought this laptop and used it for lightly less than a week before the display broke (green and pink squiggly lines all over screen). I returned it and ordered a replacement, which had the same issue after one day. Don’t waste your money."
4.0,It doesn't feel as well constructed (body wise) as I'd like.,"The computer works fine. The only thing is that it doesn't feel as well put together as I'd like. Maybe a sturdier plastic would change things. I bought it for my wife that mainly uses it for internet, but her smaller, older, HP notebook seemed sturdier. But it works just fine."
1.0,Spend more money get a better one,", sometimes when you click on it it don't actually working at the click on it again"
2.0,Not a keeper,"Out of the box the touchpad was sunken on the bottom right corner. The touchpad clicked with every touch. A design flaw or a quality control issue. Either way, a disappointment, as the laptop looked like an ok one for simple tasks. The lid was very bendy. I returned for a refund."
4.0,Chromebook competitor,"acer does a decent job at making PC's and this one is no exception. I think that one needs to keep in mind that this is not a machine designed to be a powerhouse, gaming system or dedicated video editor. It is running a low power dual core celeron with a clock speed of 1.2 Ghz. Too many Chrome windows open can bog this down.  Speaking of Chrome...or Firefox... or several other browsers and apps....If it's not in the Windows store you won't be installing it while in ""S"" mode. If you are okay with Edge browser and only Windows store apps you'll be good.  This could be a good PC for a kid, elderly or any tech-unsavy user, at least in ""S"" mode. It's far too locked down for my liking. It's very easy to get out of ""S"" mode, a couple clicks and a reboot. Sad thing about the switch is that while M$ says ""S"" mode is built from 10 PRO, when you switch out you are on 10 HOME. So don't think about domain joining, Hyper-V, bitlocker or several other PRO only features. ($99 and you can upgrade)"
5.0,"Cheap basic computer, no complaints!","My 26 year old rugged son roughs it up, keeps in backpack, smudges the screen, uses the computer for college assignments, Instagram, Soundcloud, emails, Word, Netflix, this computer is great for the price! My 17 year old daughter uses hers for Netflix, email, google docs, and it handles. Since so cheap I got each this computer for Christmas."
4.0,Laptop,"I like the size of the screen and it is light weight making it easy to fold and take with. Haven't had any issues at all, first ACER I've tried and am surprised how well it works for as inexpensive as it was"
3.0,Safe mode,I don’t like the fact Microsoft makes you purchase every app in the app stores. Or you have to disable the security system in order to download something that is not in the App Store. And once you take it out of safe mode there is no going back. So be sure to have a plan for antivirus protection.
4.0,"good for the price, but some glitches","I bought this laptop two months ago for taking notes and watching netflix. The first day or two of owning this product it would randomly turn off, and I considered returning it. However, I took the laptop out of S mode and it hasn't happened since. Occasionally there will be a glitch such as a key not working or it freezing up, but a restart has always fixed the issue. Overall, this laptop is sturdy, lasts the entire day, and automatically uploads all my documents to one drive. For the price I pay and the amount of time I've spent on this computer studying, typing, and streaming shows, I'm content with the quality."
2.0,Laptop gave me trouble after 2 months,"Around Thanksgiving, my Acer laptop (a different version) had an issue where the screen was no longer operating even though the keyboard was. So, I bought this Acer Aspire laptop. Come January, this Acer Aspire laptop's mouse pad randomly decided to stop working. It just completely stopped responding event though the screen and keyboard were fine. I was able to have the mouse fixed. However, it is slower and I cannot scroll by using two fingers on the mouse pads anymore. I am beginning to think that Acer is just not a good laptop brand."
5.0,So far works great,For the price this has been a great computer.  All we use it for is powerpoint and Youtube videos so it works great for those purposes.
1.0,No good,I didn't get the office suite and Microsoft was no help. It will not work without a mouse so I ordered one..at the moment it is frozen up.  Got it yesterday!
5.0,Value for product.,"It is a amazing laptop given its $250 price. I've been using it as my backup laptop ON and OFF recently and have not faced any issues. It starts very quickly. Does all the job. Web camera kind of sucks, but the audio is decent. I can even run software like IntelliJ. It can handle software like that. Moreover, it's touchpad might not be that great if you're used to MacBook, but overall given its price. it's 10/10."
2.0,You get what you pay for...,"tl;dr: The computer is really slow. It barley runs 5+ chrome tab. Buy it if you are just browsing the internet, otherwise look somewhere else."
1.0,The office does NOT come with it. It is a lie,"Very misleading. It claims to come with office 365, but it is only a 30 day trial and you have to pay to activate after that. It was the main reason I chose this laptop. Will not buy another laptop from this site. Incredibly deceitful"
3.0,Doesn’t have CD/DVD player,Really nice laptop for the price but didn’t realize until after I purchased that it doesn’t have a cd/dvd player.
1.0,"Very disappointing, laptop damage very quickly","When I start to use the laptop, I notice some delay and malfunction in app  and program. After more and less two week the operating system have a failure and doesn't charge the operating system. I left the laptop in a repairing center of Acer and supposedly"
3.0,Acer Aspire Lap Top,The Acer Aspire Lap Top works great. This was purchased for my 15 year teen daughter to do school projects.  But of course she watches videos and plays games whenever possible.  Yes this product is very good.  But she had it only for 2 weeks.
1.0,Fails Quickly,I have had two of these within the last two weeks and both failed within seven days. First one went black and the second the curser froze. Both  courtesly accepted for return by Amazon.
3.0,Just save up or use credit,"Guys, just save up money and buy a $600 one. Not worth it. Cant believe I bought it -- Thankfully my dad helped me get a new inspiron 14, now I just have to return this one. Just shell out for a better laptop."
4.0,Good price for a beginner laptop,Beginner laptop for a grandson.  Memory not expandable.  Screen quality is good.  I was not aware that it was a touch screen.  Construction is somewhat flimsy
5.0,Good value,Bought this for my son.  He thought I paid $$$ for it but it was really the most inexpensive one I found for what he needed.  Easy setup with 1 year of office.
4.0,Great buy!,I love this little laptop.  You really can't beat it for the price.  I would have given it 5 stars but I haven't figured out why it won't let me download the chrome browser.  That's my only drawback with it.  It has really nice picture.
2.0,Poor Workmanship,"after a month use, the frame around the screen stars splitting open at both top left and right corner. the battery runs hot than normal, the touch mouse pad is very flimsy."
5.0,Great laptop for the price!,"Great laptop for the price.  After buying one and using it for a month, I bought another."
1.0,Dead On Arrival,"Purchased this product last week and it is showing a blank white screen and not booting up.  Dead on arrival, waste of time and money. :("
5.0,Good Value,"I'm using this as a remote display to a PC that runs a sound system.  Not fast at all, but long battery life and big display."
3.0,Ok for basic use,"Good computer for basic use. I'm not sure what things I can do to elevate this laptop like everyone said. But good for simple browsing, emails, music etc. After about 7-8 tabs it starts to slow down slightly. Also the screen does not compare to my chromebook at all. If you're coming from a higher resolution product you will know instantly the difference"
3.0,Bugs after 3 months,Out of nowhere the mousepad area stop working. I have to use a handheld mouse to move the cursor. Overall a good PC though
5.0,Buy this,Awesome for the price. My parents bought one each for my daughters for Christmas and I one for themselves.
5.0,Two thumbs up,"For the price, this laptop is perfectly fine. If you’re looking for instantaneous response time, then spend $1,000 plus!"
5.0,Great price works very well,I'm more than satisfied after a month of use.  Does everything I need it to do.  What a great price for a very nice laptop.
2.0,Not worth the money!,Was told before I bought that my kids could download roblox and other similar games with ease...but not true at all!
3.0,Not a good computer for work,"If you use any of the following apps, do not buy this computer, you won't be able to use them properly because Edge does not work with Google"
2.0,Nice little computer,This is a great little computer.  I had an issue with it requiring me to purchase the free apps I use for work through the Microsoft store but found a way to bypass it.
5.0,It will do,It's OK for the price.  Does what I need for the the time being.

5.0,Good product,I love the way it looks and works. It's fairly new so I can't comment on durability yet...battery life so far is ok.
5.0,"For the price, it's great",Battery life better than expected. Screen is way too dim (probably helps with battery life). lol
5.0,Great value for the price,I had this laptop for about 2 months now.This laptop is an excellent value for my needs. It starts quickly. It has enough speed and is responsive. The only negative is the touchpad. You will want to use a wireless mouse instead.
5.0,Great for the money!,Laptop was perfect for my 9 yrs old to do his homework projects on without killing my budget. Great tech specs for my son's use.
1.0,junk,it is a complete waste of time and money
1.0,Black screen,"It was a disappointment from day 1.  I only had this for not even 2 months, and stopped working. Turned it on, came up wit Word Acer, then black screen!!  Went to the Acer customer service and was told had to pay $5 for 7 day trial, just to speak to a technician, and then be charged $49/month.  Total disappointmet."

2.0,Return,Had ro return it because it was defective
1.0,Do not buy,Piece of krapp lasted about 3 days
4.0,Would recommend to students,"The screen quality is great, and it streams Netflix/YouTube well. Having a few tabs open worn slow it down much, but I found that using edge is quicker than using chrome. Make sure you uninstall Microsoft S. All in all it works great for what I need it for, which is school work and watching movies."
3.0,Good for light process but evil Windows lol,"I like this laptop, sometimes it gets slow but that's 'cause isn't made to big process. BUT I REALLY HATE THE OPERATIVE SYSTEM IT HAS. Fortunatly I changed the System."

5.0,So far I love it,A really great deal !
1.0,Great if you only need it for 2 weeks,"Display is worse than any I’ve owned, even less expensive units.  Lasted about 2 weeks before refusing to turn on. Light plastic construction would probably have broken if computer hadn’t died so quickly."
