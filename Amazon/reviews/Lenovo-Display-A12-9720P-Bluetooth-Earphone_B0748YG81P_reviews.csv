5.0,Solid Quality Inexpensive Laptop,"After researching for a high quality laptop that would not break the bank, I finally chose this one. For a few months, I looked at many other manufacturers. There is a lot of 'bang for your buck' in the Lenovo Ideapad 320. Over the past few years, I've repaired laptops, built computers, and reconfigured systems. Lenovo has not disappointed with their products."
4.0,"Cruddy battery, otherwise a really good computer for the price-range.",This computer has two significant con's:
5.0,"For the price range, it does an excellent job.","I needed a new laptop as I am in a graduate program that uses statistical software, and my old laptop simply could not keep up with some of the permutation and bootstrap analyses when dealing with more than a hundred data points. With this, I can run several analyses in R back-to-back-to-back in just a few seconds, making my life much easier. As for gaming, you won't be able to run anything too intensive, but I can play Rocket League on max settings without any lag or other issues."
2.0,Laptop died in 6 months or less for me.....not good,"I have never had a Lenovo computer or laptop and Windows 10 is a new thing for me. My desktop computer is a homemade Windows 7 & really runs well with no issues.  I needed a fairly decent 15.6 inch laptop to take when I go out of town for vacations and such and decided to get this Lenovo laptop with Windows 10. This is an extremely slow computer, short battery life of maybe 3 hours [I used the ""balanced setting"" for battery life on this laptop] and this computer froze up and died on me after just 5 or 6 months of periodic light use. Seems fragile also and flimsy built. The Windows 10 is fine.....confusing but as fine as I expect. This laptop has pretty much what I needed on it....webcam, 15.6 LED screen, full keyboard, DVD burner, SD card reader, several USB ports and a 1 TB regular non-solid state hard drive installed. Getting the initial Windows 10 to load up was long...2 or 3 hours long. Several times when I powered this laptop up, it would take up to 30 minutes to finally load up windows 10. Finally a few days ago, this laptop totally froze up and sat for over 5 hours without fully starting up and died when I tried to reboot it. I was going to simply replace the hard drive, reload Windows 10 on it and go on with life....but I ended up dusting off an 8 year old [2010] Windows 7 laptop from another computer maker and modernized it with beefed up hard drive and memory and it works better than this Windows 10 laptop ever did."
4.0,"Nice screen and keyboard, short battery capacity",It is an okay laptop and nothing more.  It obviously depends on what you want to do with it.  I would not expect this to work well for gaming or other tasks requiring movement of huge data stacks back and forth.
5.0,It is not the best laptop out there,"I'm giving this five stars considering the price. It is not the best laptop out there, but for under $400 I think it is definitely one of the better ones. I have a very nice desktop pc so I was not in the market for an amazing laptop because more processor intensive tasks like video editing or gaming can easily be handled on my desktop. That being said, I have found myself using this a lot more than my desktop simply because it is convenient to have access to a laptop and this one handles normal tasks extremely well. It's fast compared to other laptops I've tried int this price range, and it doesn't feel cheap in it's construction. It can also run modded Skyrim with no issues, which is nice bonus for me."
3.0,Good for the price.,As good as its going to get.  The laptop is awesome for the price.  Fast computer and plays the games that I play on the laptop pretty good.  By no means is it a gaming laptop but it works for sims 4 and low quality games.  I use it for school work I just bought this one to replace my HP notebook that recently died on me.  I'm happy with the product but the battery life sucks the charger is short.  The lightweight is awesome and the color and make are great.  I would recommend to other people.  Lenovo is a great company and this laptop is cool.
5.0,Lenovo IdeaPad 320-15ABR,"Great Item! Delivery was a bit off but I blame USPS on that, they suck in my area."
1.0,They are not very good. Then,"Ok, I read the reviews here on Amazon, tried to save money and that was my mistake.  If you are interested in this computer, google the reviews.  They are not very good.  Then, go look at all the used 320's for sale on Amazon and ask yourself why?  Because it is dog slow.  My 8 year old notebook that I was replacing was faster than this one.  Slow to start up.  Slow to load images.  You get what you pay for, so spend a little more and be happy.  I returned this and got the ASUS VivoBook F510UA Thin and Lightweight FHD WideView Laptop, 8th Gen Intel Core i5-8250U, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 128GB SSD+1TB HDD, USB Type-C, ASUS NanoEdge Display, and could not be happier.  Blazingly fast.  $500, but I got the one with the SSD card already installed for $569.  Highly recommend it."
5.0,The search is over,"Stop what you’re doing now and get this computer! The search is over. This computer is the best thing you can get under 400 dollars. Lots of space, fast, and it will last a long time with ita top shelf technology. Good enough to game on. I would rate this computer higher than my MacBook. Perfect for college, office, or gaming."
1.0,Audio was horrible for YouTube clips,"Junk. Crashed after one week. Before that it ran very slow. I bought to only surf the internet. Audio was horrible for YouTube clips. It kept making a clicking noise, unit I to stopped running the pre-installed virus scanning software."
1.0,Lenovo is not helping!,"I am a college student!  I bought this Labtop in June , The motherboard as crashed already!  I been on the phone for days to get satisfaction ,  Sent out tech with bad motherboard replacement and know I waiting again to get a new tech to come out ! HELP!!!!!!!!"
1.0,"Green screen, doesn't work, terrible customer support","If you want to waste money and spend months going in circles, go ahead and buy this. Otherwise, steer clear of anything from Lenovo. This has been my experience so far:"
2.0,Another Lenovo disappointment,"Bought in July.  7 months later, it died.  Warranty is this: send it in.  In 9-10 days they send it back.  The warranty doesn't let you take it into a Best Buy or someplace.  The O/S stopped loading and diagnostics fail to work.  I can't even reset the O/S.  I suspect a h/w failure.  I don't care b/c I have already decided not to be bothered sending it in.  I can buy cr@ppy laptops used for $100 or less and they are probably as reliable if not moreso than Lenovo machines.  For $150, fine.  Make sure you back up everything all the time.  But for $350 it's a rip-off.  Do yourself a favor: get a used laptop off craigslist and a new 1-2 TB ext hard drive and set up backup to it.  Then run it until it breaks.  Then get another one, restore your stuff, and do it again.  Rinse and repeat.  Or spend like $1000 for a laptop that won't break but that you are sure to drop or your cat will pee on it or whatnot.  Really, these things are practically disposable.  They should be a lot cheaper.  In fact I should chuck them and stick to my phone.  It has more RAM and CPU power anyway."
5.0,You Can't beat the price,"I am truly enjoying my laptop after one month. I use it for streaming with the Elgato device and it doesn't miss a beat. You can't beat the price for what you are getting with this computer. Love the graphics when I replay my videos or watch other streamers. The quad core makes it run so much smoother than any other computer I have owned. If you need a decent computer that runs quality this is it, especially if you are starting out. I did plenty of research for 6 months on what type of laptop I needed and you are not going to beat the price even through Lenovo themselves."
3.0,I would pay a bit more for a better laptop.,"At first when I bought the laptop it was running great. After about a month it started slowing down extremely. It has a software that predicts what you are going to do next to tey to optimize your performance. Delete it. Also the brightness is horrible, i was trying to do work today at the ballfield and you can not turn up the brightness enough to see if tou were to take it outside."
5.0,Good,"I am really satisfied with my purchase. The laptop is the perfect size, it’s not too heavy and it’s slim."
5.0,need time to first update,bought for my daughter collage work she is happy  took several hours to update but worked perfect out of box after
5.0,Five Stars,Purchased as a Mothers Day gift but I've come to respect the quality and performance of Lenovo.
5.0,"Excellent price, I bought it for a beginner in art design field. Sufficient speed for gaming.","Fast delivery, thanks to Amazon. Excellent price, I bought it for a beginner in art design field. Sufficient speed for gaming."
5.0,"High Def Graphics, affordable Price",When I ordered this I was shopping for the exact same model via Canadian sites. I was actually looking at this piece from newegg when someone was able to help me compare shop and found this for me via the US store. It was 250 dollars cheaper even with the conversation factored in.
5.0,Really satisfied with this big ticket Laptop!,"It's been about 3 weeks since my purchase of my Lenova laptop and figure it's time to give my all important review. After my initial update of Windows 10 and Lenova drivers I can honestly say I am one satisfied buyer. As some earlier reviews noted, you may want to purchase a SSD to make the laptop even faster. Love the price reduction and the Lenova one year warranty. A+"
1.0,I FEEL SCAMMED!!,"I loved this laptop at first it did everything I needed it to, but it suddenly stopped working after only 4 months and the seller isn’t helping me to fix it, they just keep telling me to contact the manufacturer. Well I say that is unexecptable, I can’t even return it to get it fixed or for a refund. I feel scammed, selling me something that works just long enough to get out of any return policy, I’m so disappointed because the laptop was working really great at first, it literally just shit off in the middle of using it and will not turn back on. What am I supposed to do now I’m out over 300$ and no one is trying to help me."
5.0,Easy set up,Laptop booted right up and the set up waa super easy. In a matter of minutes it was fully running
1.0,Is this laptop supposed to work? Cause it ain't.,"Wow you guys had this thing running for a month? Mine quit working on day three. I didn't even get a chance to download anything other than software updates and drivers before I got caught in an infinite loop of loading up, then bluescreen. Couldn't even system restore for some reason. I'm guessing they flubbed up installing Windows or that's just the generalized Windows 10 experience. I was going to wait until after I send it in and and see if they'll fix it to write a review,but then I realized: Hey, this is supposed to work as soon as I open it. So yeah, I consider myself hard to disappoint considering the general motif of my life but this one slipped through the cracks."
5.0,I love this computer,"I bought this for college to do my homework and also pay my bills. It is very easy to use the set up was awesome. That said if you're not a computer savvy no worries  as soon as you turn it on Cortana the computers  assistant walks you through everything that you need to do. She let you set up your Internet, link the computer to your phone, etc. I have had no issues with it since I bought it I would highly recommend it. Are used to have a Dell and this is so much easier to use and the price is so much better. I will definitely buy from them again."
1.0,Graphics are going to be a major problem!,I researched and watched for 4 months before I bought this laptop. It was great at first. I've now had it for a month and the colors on the fonts start shaking and turning colors. Im an online student so when I'm on discusion boards the letters turn from black to purple to blue. And icons fade in and out. Its still usable but I can see there being big problems with the graphics in the future. I bought the warranty but cant send it off because I cant be without it. What a bummer!!!!!!!! I wish I would have not gotten this one :(
1.0,Horrible Laptop Experience,Laptop review
2.0,Bought this as I wait for a liver transplant to simply enjoy and write on--FAIL!,"Since being diagnosed with end stage liver disease (Stage 4, no stage five, only death without a transplant). My prognosis wasn't great at first, so I figured this laptop might outlive me. Well...I'm doing better, laptop not so much!"
2.0,Sticky and Non-Functioning Keys in a Respected Brand,"I returned it. Very  difficult to just depress the keys, frequently I'd press but nothing would appear. Trouble in adjusting the contrast, trouble in getting things plugged in, ports didn't seem quite the right size. Good weight and size but using it was troublesome. Coming with no instructions, one had to be psychic as to how to do certain basic function. I appreciate that a text book on how to use a computer isn't to be expected but some information should be included. The sad thing for me is that I've had several Lenovos and was very pleased. Perhaps I got a poorly made model but....I could not escape the fact that some of what I've mentioned may be the reason it was so deeply discounted."
5.0,Excellent price! Fast!,"This laptop is excellent. Works fast. I unloaded some ""bloatware"" that it came with, which also increased download speed. It does not have a touch screen, so I had to give 1 star has it is asked on star rating review. I won't know how it works for gaming because I don't do that. My son does, he said it's ""average"", based on the specs, so I gave it three stars."
4.0,I Actually Like This Laptop,"Pros: Nice size, clear screen, quick on start up, very functional and easy to use. It's also very lightweight, so it's easy to carry around. I love the fact that it can extend and be flat. The keyboard is a nice size and the pads clicks on touch and not stiff or hard. It also has a lot of space and memory."
1.0,Keyboard not working.,Keyboard was not working at all. Already asked for a refund. Battery life is absolute crap. Very disappointed. I was expecting happinnes and got spat in the face. All shipping cost won't be refunded. Thank you for absolutely nothing.
4.0,Great laptop for the price,"After reading a lot of the reviews on here,I was unsure about laptop. Guess I got a good one. I took off the virus software that it came with and it is very fast. I'm using it mainly to store movies,and the 1 tb drive is nice. Only con would be that display is not that bright, although I would say at the brightest setting is probably where it should be. Also audio is pretty decent. Coming from Windows 7 ,it will take a few days to learn Windows 10. Nice and thin, light, surprised it has a DVD player in it. I'm happy, fast shipping and good seller."
1.0,... amazeing until I found out the battery life is horrible and not,Planning on returning it was amazeing until I found out the battery life is horrible and not removable
3.0,unnecessary cord tangle,"This replaced a 10 year old Lenovo.  If one does not have a smart phone, the opening page can be daunting.  The surprise of a ""talk through"" setup (with some annoying verbal tics) was a little confusing at times.  No Microsoft Word is a big detraction although a free version can be loaded.  Fortunately someone else took care of a data transfer and managed to replicate the screen to what I had been used to for a decade."
4.0,"give and take, but a great price for what it is","I loved how fast it was. Played Heroes of the Storm with graphics up full and wasn't any lag. Webpages load quickly. The only problem I found was that maybe because of the low resolution screen (it's kinda ugly compared to some other screens) chrome seems to have serious issues displaying text and complicated graphics properly. I returned my first lenovo thinking it was the computer, but when my second one did it too, I figured out it was the combo of the lenovo screen and the chrome browser. So I'll be using chrome a lot less I guess. Only thing I really didn't like about this was how quickly the battery drained. But I guess, it's got a lot of power going to that processor so you can't have it all. Just bring your charger cord. :)"
1.0,Good performance but received inoperative,Set up was easy but the laptop would not read my external hard drive units. Called Lenovo and they said that since the USB port was working they'd offer no assistance whatsoever to resolve the problem. They told me to call Seagate to have them properly configure the laptop. I sent it back to Amazon as defective. Lenovo is a **** company when you call them. I had a unit several years ago and had to send it in for repair seven times about the same issue and now their technical support offers no support for a new device:
5.0,A truly great deal!,"Great computer.  Fast, sturdy with a beautiful display."
3.0,Three Stars,"It's definitely not winning any races, but it functions. You get what you pay for."
1.0,DO NOT BUY!,"This laptop is horrible! I bought this for my mom to use at work. After using it for less then 90 days the sound system completely crashed. I don’t know why it started sounded robotic/static like and we can’t understand what any audio is saying. She barely uses it for YouTube videos and takes very good care of it. Keeps it in a case, on the table, never dropped. Makes sure it’s elevated so it doesn’t over heat. So no reason it should break down this fast. The return window has closed and now we aren’t sure what to do! Pretty convenient that it started acting up right after the return window shut. We paid pretty good money for this laptop, which fell apart in 2 months! Very unhappy and would like to return it for a refund!"
5.0,This is a really nice computer,"It has way more than I will ever need because all I do is check my email and Facebook, but it is crazy fast.  I finally decided to buy a new one when it took me three days to create a Craigslist post with my old computer.  I am really happy with this.  My only complaint is that the mouse keypad is a little big.  I don't really have anywhere to rest my hand when I use it because it's so large.  Otherwise I really do love it."
1.0,Not Friendly to CD Based Games/Okay for office work/Overpriced,"Unless you only want  run Microsoft office/google docs and other related actions, looks somewhere else for a computer. I bought this because it is semi budget friendly and, based on the specifications, I thought it could handle some old school games I enjoyed back in the day. However, this is not the case, it runs very few games. At first I thought my games were damaged or bad, but then I installed the fifth games with the same crashes and decided this computer is not meant for games, even old ones that run fine on older laptops or desktops. The games I've tried that have NOT worked include but are not limited to:"
1.0,DO NOT BUY!! EQUIVALENT TO SCRAP METAL!,"apps crash on a regular basis, apps and screen freeze and only way to fix is to restart. system ridiculously slow. HORRIBLE PRODUCT.  product return for refund was denied due to one day past return eligibility. DO NOT BUY!! EQUIVALENT TO SCRAP METAL!"
4.0,Works good,"It has been working fine for what I needed it for, school work and editing photos, it can sometimes lag when working on photos but usually it only a minute or less nothing I can't work with. It's not touch screen, and now I do wish the keyboard was backlit but not a huge deal breaker. The keyboard work great and feels nice. The screen is fine but I find myself readjusting it to get the right angle I want when I move around (sitting on the couch). Oh the battery life needs improvement. I get about 3 & 1/2 hrs out of it before having to plug it in.  so if you plan to be out somewhere with no power be quick, or at least watch you battery life so u don't lose anything."
1.0,Terrible laptop!,I bought this laptop as a backup and had it  for less than a month and used it maybe twice. I noticed that it was very slow and it froze up  while I was in the middle of a very important cohort class. I can't tell you how frustrated I was! Needless to say I returned it and glad I was able to get a full refund. Never again will I buy that brand. You get what you pay for and that's for sure. It's not worth it just to save a couple of bucks. For now on I will stick with what I know. I would give it zero stars if I could.
1.0,"Poorly made, delicate.","First off, let me state that the seller took the return and provided a refund without a hassle (good). This laptop started to come apart the first day out of the box. It started to come apart at the seems (the cover/border to the screen kept separating and had to be snapped back together. Then the hinge cover came off and one of the corners cracked and peeled up before snapping off."
2.0,Find something better,"Very unimpressed with this computer. For starters, I'm lucky if I can get 2 hours without plugging it into the outlet. Even worse, the startup for anything takes ages. I have to wait at lease 15 minutes after I open up my computer before I can run anything. Sometimes, the computer will get stuck at the startup screen and I have to wait for the darn thing to restart. Only reason I'm giving this an extra star is that once it does finally start working, it runs very smoothly. So if you're crunched for money and need a quick fix, this is your buy. If you want quality, start shopping elsewhere."
5.0,Simple and Quick,I love this laptop so far. The start up process was very simple and relatively quick. I was able to download all of my games in a quick amount of time too. So far so good!
4.0,Good laptop for the price.,This was a very affordable laptop. I like the gray body with a darker gray keyboard. That makes it easier to see the keyboard. It's a real nice size. Light weight. Over all a real nice laptop. Issues: Battery life sucks. And the screen resolution is not the best. It seems very soft. I wish it had a more vivid setting. I have looked but do not see that as an option. Not a bad computer but not top of the line. Of course the price was amazing. I would recommend this product to friends but warn them of the issues.
5.0,Great for school and home use,I love my laptop but the battery life is the worst I’ve ever had on a laptop. If you can leave it plugged in most of the time your working it will be ok. I even had to buy a an ac adapter car charger to keep it plugged in in the car between classes at school. I haven’t used it much for gaming but I imagine it works fine. It’s still loading and working pretty fast and you can’t beat the storage for the price. Overall I’m happy with it for what i use it for. If your main priority is a long lasting battery this isn’t for you.
2.0,Dissatisfied," I’m honestly disappointed. I was nothing short of ecstatic to get a laptop, only to be terribly let down. It’s super slow, please keep in mind I have the best internet Verizon has to offer. Also, nothing else in my house is slow. I want to do something as simple as import photos from my phone, doesn’t work. It says that nothing is connected when my phone most definitely is. Can’t even login to messenger because it continues to say I was putting in the wrong code when I wasn’t. Now it won’t even send me a new code at all. I can’t even login to my email. The battery is 3/4 dead and I’ve done nothing because I keep receiving errors."
5.0,don't buy refurbished unless you trust the seller,"this laptop is crap.  mainly because whoever worked on it didn't do their job and sometimes it has a mind of it's own and settings are different from one day to the next.  a piece fell off the hinged area and can't be fixed because part is missing to snap it back on.  I'm not real tech savvy but I know crappy products when I see this.  And because it started messing up after the 30 day, I didn't get a refund nor any kind of compensation."
2.0,"Incredibly short battery life, washed out screen, and a day 1 minor crash.","My experiences in the brief time I've had this laptop so far have been quite negative. A crash on day one is never a good thing, but we'll see if that establishes a pattern. Less forgivable and more continual offenses include a screen with bizarrely washed out seeming colors, unpleasant speakers, the only USB port being on the left side of the computer (sorry, right handed usb mouse users), and, most ridiculously of all, a battery life which seems to drain faster than the time it takes to charge."
5.0,"Lenovo dependability, and function.","Received my new Lenovo Ideapad yesterday, so very new, and Windows 10 + Internet connectivity works very well. Amateur ""HAM"" Radio is my hobby, and have been using my Lenovo Desktop in my Radio Station since 2007 with no hiccups. After so many years of satisfaction, I felt only Lenovo would I buy when I purchased this Laptop. I have my Lenovo Desktop hooked up to my Radio via the Serial Port, and all works extremely well. I can operate all functions of my Radio Station via the Desktop easily, and can Transmit & Receive very many types of Digital Communications, and Television around the World and into Outer Space to the International ""Space"" station at will, as well as assist digital Military Communications . Thank You Lenovo for all the great years. Wishing all of Lenovo employee's the very best.  ""73"" de David Walton - ARS - W7CAR Rainier, Oregon"
1.0,MONEY HUNGRY CUSTOMER “ SUPPORT”,"Bough5 it on recommendation of someone, but discovered that in 2 months time, I had speed issues and more and Called customer service of Lenovo , I was amazed that the rep. Told me I had to first pay for any servic3 related issues."
5.0,This is a very nice computer,"My husband is not techy at all and we wanted something simple for him to surf and place some orders.  He does not need an office suite or gaming.  It is a very nice computer that serves his needs very well.  He has not had any problem using it and is on it a LOT!  For us, it was perfect.  Thank you! Great price for a great value."
4.0,It's a Good Buy,"The laptop works well, I have no complaints. It's gets the job done for simple everyday tasks as there is not much I use it to do. I love how sleek and thin it is. If you're big on aesthetics then you'll love the look. The only  draw back with this PC is the battery life which lasts about 3 hrs before needing to be charged. Otherwise it's pretty okay."
2.0,Still having issues isn’t there a manufacturer warranty?,"I received this on Sunday.  I have super wifi connect at home and this laptop is extremely slow, i'm having issues when trying to download any app, it won't let me do anything unless I accept permissions, when I click no, it doesn't download.... so I can't download anything because I don't want to grant the permissions for apps to go into my private computer.  Am I doing something wrong?  It's been years since I've had a laptop and I don't remember it being this hard to figure out."
5.0,Nice laptop; great price for the specs!,"Great price for a nice laptop. Bought this for my daughter's senior year of college and she's very happy. Checked this price against other big box stores, and this was a better deal all the way around."
3.0,"Very good laptop, fits my needs perfectly, however too many quirks to put up with.","Like: light weight, clear screen, easy to use"
1.0,Some of the keys are not functioning with the correct symbols.,I like this system because it in not too heavy to carry around.
2.0,Slowest computer I've ever owned,"After owning nothing but Dell laptops all my life, I figured I would give Lenovo a try. Big mistake. The laptop functions, but it is so mind-numbingly slow that I find myself dreading when I have to use it. The fan runs constantly, making it sound like the laptop is about to lift off into space, and the computer frequently acts as though it is utilizing all of the power at its disposal, even when I'm simply using Word or surfing online. I really cannot impart how frustratingly slow this computer is. Just awful."
2.0,Not worth it. Terribly slow,Wanted to use for just a basic online banking and looking at internet and photos. It had a hard time loading Office 365 and even though there is little in the start up it takes minutes to actually be ready for use. I was disappointed because the features seemed more than minimal to handle what we wanted to do with it. Amazon gives a short window of support and return so not sure what we are going to do.
5.0,This computer is good for under $400,"I bought this with Spring Ocean. I gotta say this was my first ever online computer/laptop order and let me tell you its pretty good. 8G is enough to do most daily activities, I use NVIDIA GeForce Now to play much higher end games like Destiny 2, R6 and what not. I should say this computer can handle fornite in medium settings and semi-high settings for CSGO without GeForce Now. the only cons are the battery and the brightness of the screen. But if that is not something you care for this computer if you're on a budget. If you have 500 dollars, go buy the ASUS Vivobook as that has a more powerful CPU. anyways solid computer if on a budget."
2.0,Freezes,"I researched forever and thought this computer would be best for me based on what I wanted to do: edit Word documents, run Google Chrome, and track my work time through a time tracker app. So far, it has frozen twice. During these times, I was editing documents, tracking time, and listening to music on Youtube. I've not been to any suspicious sites or opened any sketchy documents. There is no virus; this is a problem with the computer. It should be able to handle those three things. Instead, it freezes and makes a terrible racket. I'm left with the nuclear option of the force restart each time, which wastes my time and jeopardizes my work."
1.0,Grey screen,"After having this for about three months it is now randomly coming up on a grey screen when powered on. I went on Youtube and looked for a fix, well there was one. Now it is crashing and going to that grey screen when in use not just when started, not very productive when my daughter loses all the homework shes been working on. Before you buy look up Leveno grey screen wish I had. I guess if you intend to buy buy the extended warranty, good thing I did."
5.0,Great buy. I wouldn't have changed a thing,Great buy. I wouldn't have changed a thing. Easy for me to do my work on but not really for heavy gaming. I downloaded The Sims 4 but haven't played it. My kids have played Roblox and Minecraft on it along with Fortnite so I think it can handle online gaming pretty good. No complaints so far
3.0,it’s not terrible. Slow and the battery dies quickly,"For the price, it’s not terrible. Slow and the battery dies quickly. I’ve had it for less than a month and the mouse pad doesn’t work. I’ve been using a USB mouse and it’s been fine. It’s durable, and that what I was looking for but I would suggest spending a little more money on something that doesn’t break 3 weeks in."
1.0,Terrible Battery Life,"Over all, the machine is on par for its price range. Not top notch quality -- it feels a little flimsy, but for the most part, you get what you pay for, and that quality is expected. What you don't get, any price aside, is a usable battery life. 2 hours,...maybe? If your lucky. 45 minutes into a full charge and my laptop magically turns into a $300 paperweight. Its a good laptop but being tethered to the wall is kind of counter productive. 3 months in since I bought mine and I'm throwing it away and buying something with a reasonable battery life. Don't waste your money like I did. It would have been a good laptop, but the ""battery,"" if you can call it that, ruins it."
2.0,Look elsewhere,This device is so slow in reacting to simple commands and it sets the standard for turtles.  Even simple commands (mouse clicks) send it into a stuttering mess.  And trying to download anything becomes a nightmare in patience.  Not worth the cost unless you are desperate for a cheap laptop and I’m sure you can find a better device elsewhere.
4.0,Dependable machines,"About my 3rd Lenovo.  My last one I didn't buy enough capacity although it's still working fine; the one previous to that I spilled liquid on (oops), although I bought a keyboard and it still works.  This is a brand I look for that I feel I can trust."
1.0,Anyone want give review about product..Pls use atleast one month and review the product,Guys ..
2.0,Freezes after 1-2 hours without fail,"No touchscreen. Freezes after 1-2 hrs. Pretty much useless. I thought I was getting a deal but nope. Won’t play any games cause the graphics and ram are not good enough. So it’s only good for surfing the web, Watching YouTube, typing etc. I’d send it back but it’s too much trouble to reset it so none of my info would be on there, so I’m out $345..."
1.0,Very disappointed in this buy,The USB ports do not work. Very disappointed in this buy. I won't be recommending LENOVO again. I have bought several Lenovo laptops over the last two years. There is a issue with the USB ports
1.0,not that great,when using the laptop the fan runs extremely loud and its pretty slow
3.0,Very basic laptop,I got what I paid for in terms of price. I got this specifically for work and mostly for Excel. The laptop was very slow to start up. It was also slow on loading web sites that have lots of graphics. The battery life was 2 hrs top! My last complaint is that the screen quality is poor. The keyboard was great. It’s nice having the extra 10 key on there if you work with numbers. It was lightweight and easy to set up. I ended up giving it away and ordering something else.
1.0,Don't buy... EVER!,"I had this computer for 3 months, the screen started changing funky colors, the barttery life didn't last long, it just was not what I expected a computer that was almost $400 to be. About 6 months in having it, while typing papers for college, or just googling things text would turn pink or blue (I've never had this happen before on any other computer or device). I would just save your money and never buy this product. Since then I've been using my aunt's computer that is 4-5 years old and it still works better...."
4.0,Too early to be complemental/critical,This computer was bought as a replacement one for my wife. It was only received a week today so I am astill setting it up for my wife...I would not trust her to make any comments. My initial comments are the lack of indicator lights at the front/top to show what the HD is doing. One cannot be expected to keep turning around the laotop to see if the lights are on.  But most of all is the very close placement of the USB inlets. I have great difficulty in detaching a USB which is sooo close the next one.
1.0,Save your money,"What a disappointment to say the least.  I had a Dell for YEARS.  I finally broke down and purchased this glorious POS.  Since the quality and functionality are so sour, I haven't used it much, nor downloaded anything on to here.  With that being said, the hard drive crashed within 3 months.  It was out of the warranty provided by Amazon so I had to deal with Lenovo directly- and wow.  I had to send it to them, where they had it for almost 3 weeks.  It's slow AF.  The sound and video quality are a joke.  Like dead ass, they shouldn't even have a camera or speakers on here.  Ok i guess that's all.  And again, save your money."
3.0,"3 months in, screen is glitching","Purchased this laptop in June, it arrived on the 30th. I had no complaints until about a week ago when my screen started behaving oddly. So far it's nothing major - just flashes of green for a brief second or two across the middle of the screen, or the text in the top of the screen is oddly colored until I scroll over it. However, it's concerning that this is happening after only 3 months, and that the return and support windows closed after 2 months. I'm still giving it 3 stars because so far it still works."
1.0,Run the other way,Where do I even begin?  Bizarre screen settings that require deep Google searches to resolve.  Bluetooth mouse dies if you use the adjacent USB port to connect with anything.  Kindergarten level keyboard.  Soooooo slooooooow.  You get what you pay for on this one.  I may light this one on fire once I get a replacement.
5.0,Great quality for price (8GB),"No dislikes. Easy setup. Great quality for the price. This is a school laptop for our 9 year old.  For the price, the product is great and fast enough to handle multiple applications. Obviously not comparable to a $1,000 laptop. However great for school work, video streaming, programming  and browsing the web. Our child and us are very hapoy with the product. This is our 3rd Lenovo Laptop addition. All products have been very reliable over the years."
3.0,Acceptable... good word for it,After cleaning out windows 10 it's a decent pc good for decade old pc games and video and audio production multicore processor has a joke of a GPU (just forget the idea of gpu) this is more for creating stuff rather than playing it excellent multitasking if you run it bare bones
1.0,Useless,"I bought this laptop in July for a simple at home computer. We use it a few times a week to pay bills and miscellaneous things.... for the last week or so I haven't even been able to open any browser, whether it be internet, windows, folders, etc. In order to shut it down I have to do ctrl+alt+del. I bought the insurance with it but it only covers accidental things. If Lenovo or Amazon has any suggestions... I'd really appreciate it. As of now, this laptop is completely useless."
1.0,5 months old and the screen is going...,"I bought this computer on June 23rd, 2018. It sucks. I'm lucky to get 2 hours of use just browsing the internet and doing basic photo editing on the battery. The screen is glitching and already going out. Use if for basic gaming, nothing online or anything, and I'm lucky to get an hours play time. The Enter button on my keypad only works when you hit it just right.  My 4 year old $100 computer is currently working better and lasting longer than this one."
3.0,Processor speed,Received this on Wednesday and now says battery plugged int not charging updated bios same issue. Other wise ok computer
1.0,Do NOT buy,"This is the worst computer I have ever owned. I purchased the Lenovo Ideapd 15.6” in the fall and only use it for school. The amount of time it takes to boot is absolutely absurd for a computer less than a year old. I do not have pictures or other files saved on the drive that could explain the slow processing speed. I had to take the computer to a repair shop because it was impossible to use, and simple tasks would take 3x as long to complete due to the delay. It was recommended that I replace the hard drive. I am now using my 8 year old computer because it works faster than this piece of junk. Do NOT waste your money."
5.0,Great laptop for the price,I needed a laptop with more memory to run my crafting programs.  This is just perfect.  The programs run great with no lag time.  Very happy with this laptop although not a fan of Windows 10.
5.0,Five Stars,Works great and looks great. Best bang for your buck laptop currently on the market.
4.0,"I do like it, just now that I had time to ...","I am writing my post from this pc.  I do like it,  just now that I had time to use it in preparing for my exams, the following was observed:-"
5.0,Ease of Use,Everything works well and sounds crystal clear. Came undamaged and in a plain brown box. I expect to get many years of service from this laptop. It prints very well. Full color prints. Great for my recipe collection. I set up email and it was easy to do.
1.0,"Slow, slow, slow!","I replaced a 5 year old cheap laptop that was glitchy, refused to upgrade to windows 10, and finally got stuck in a never ending boot cycle.  I had a very low bar and I still think this laptop sucks.  I've had it about 4 months and I've used it minimally because it's infuriating.  It can barely handle running a single browser window.  I've barely added anything additional to it (seriously like Office, iTunes, and Dropbox).  There's no excuse for this ridiculously bad performance."
3.0,"otherwise its annoying to, use with the touch pad","For the average person who cares not for little windows 10 limits its ok, otherwise its annoying to,use with the touch pad, its just,not smooth to touch and rather glitchy as well as constant ads from lenova popping up just left a bad taste in my mouth.."
5.0,So far so good,"Great laptop if you're on a budget, tons of space, good screen quality, good speed. This is perfect for for browsing, editing docs, even streaming video. The only drawback I've encountered is the battery life is awful. You're looking at 3-4 hours when unplugged. Doesn't really have an effect on me but if you're on the go you may want to look at something else. But if you're looking for something for home use, this is an excellent choice."
3.0,Horrible battery life,The performance of this laptop surprised me. I bought this thinking that I would have a nice laptop in the mid range price but the battery barely lasts two hours if you lower your resolution and aren't gaming or doing any resource intensive computing.
2.0,"Bad battery life, very laggy performance","Very nice looking laptop. Body and screen are good. Keyboard nice. But it dies within a few hours, you can actually watch the percentage count down. Besides that it constantly has trouble working in general. Clicking on the start button takes about a solid minute for anything to pop up. Always has that ""processing"" sound like it's trying to do something. Im not sure if it's the materials used or some kind of programming problem, I'm no computer expert, but the laptop I got has not worked well from day one unfortunately :("
4.0,Nice Laptop,Liking it a lot. Haven't had it long so only 4 stars but if it holds up it's worth 5. Running some large pro audio and photo software and haven't had a glitch yet. Has nice features  for the price and nice video for streaming movies. I'm not a gamer so I don't need more computer than this. Would recommend.
1.0,VERY SLOW,I got it for my wife so she could work at home when needed.  Unfortunately it is very very slow and it is going back to Lenovo.
1.0,Died after 5 Months,"So i have used this as a netbook, playing netflix and browsing the web. At only 5 months it no longer works and wont boot up. I have yet to find a solution to get it to work. Would not recomend."
1.0,noise and slow,"This laptop was supposed to be faster but it is too slow and I have not even installed any software yet, i just watched some videos on youtube and its making noises like if the hard disk is crash or something, I am worry because if is slow now I do not even imagine how muc it will be in a couple of month, I do not think that i will buy something like anymore. I gave 1*."
5.0,Boots up fast. Lots of storage!,Does everything I need. Just a home PC laptop that works very well.. Great feel to the keyboard as well.
4.0,Decent laptop for the price.,"Using it for doing programming, app development, and electronics projects.  Battery life is horrible though.  At full charge and doing nothing, it reports that it has 2 hours left.  At 80% and using a couple of web browsers, it usually reports that it's got about an hour left of charge."
5.0,Good Price,I was happy to find a laptop at this price. I needed one to use certain programs. I thought that was a good price for what I needed. When I opened it I thought it was beautiful and after setting it up it works well. I am glad I know have and can use it. I hope it continues to work well for me.
5.0,This is a really nice computer!,It is exactly what I was looking for. I bought it for my wife and am still configuring it but certainly appreciate the quality of both materials and design. IT IS TRULY A BARGAIN!!! Thank you.
1.0,Keys are messed up,Received the laptop and the keyboard is messed up.  When you press a key it isn’t what it is supposed to be.
3.0,Worked but usb is broken,"I bought this laptop and it worked fine! it wasn't too slow and it has good screen quality. But the usb drives were really tight. I kept trying to use one but it wouldnt work with any drive i put in it! having only one usb, as someone going to college soon, it was not very handy. A friend of mine had this same issue. Not buying this laptop again"
5.0,So far so good,"This AMD powered Lenovo arrived on time. The packaging was good. The setup was easy. I like the full size keyboard that fits into this 15 inch laptop. It is fast and its design is nice. Oh, and the price tag was the best part! I recommend!"
5.0,Large keyboard and screen -- easy  to use!,"I had a Lenovo at a job a few years ago and was familiar with the quality of the line. This laptop exceeds my expectations for a mid-price laptop.  It has a full size keyboard, a number pad, a camera, and great big screen!  It's lightweight and easy to use.  I am very pleased so far."
4.0,SUPER FAST BUT SOME STREAMING VIDEO APPS FREEZE THE COMPUTER,"This is a super fast computer and I really like it. The only problem is that certain streaming video applications freeze up in Windows 10 and I cannot remember how I resolved the problem on my old laptop. The customer support rep at Amazon was of no help, though he did try."
4.0,Great value for money,"My previous computer died after nearly 7 years, an HP. I needed a computer and I needed it to be cheap (yeah, a 7 y/o computer's death caught me by surprise, my bad). So after reading dozens of reviews for other computers in a $350-$450 range, I went for the Lenovo 320. The specs were nice, it looked nice, it was on the low end of my budget."
4.0,Keys falling off!!,"I use this laptop for work. Moderate to heavy typing. I purchased the laptop in August, and I already have a couple of keys popping off. Otherwise, it's a good computer. All the programs I need to run seem to run with no issues. It's pretty fast even with heavy use and multiple applications running at once. I almost always keep it plugged in, so I can't comment on battery life. My only concern is durability. If a few keys are already popping off approx 5 months in, I worry that it was not made to last."
1.0,the battery game and for a few days last about ...,"the battery came and for a few days last about 5hr per charge, after it lasted 2hr and now cannot run without being plugin , this happen in a week of use."
1.0,Did not work properly from the very beginning.,"WiFi stopped working the first day, Bluetooth had to be re enabled Everytime I turned the computer on.  Security PIN locked out everytime. After having to restart everything after just one day...not worth the headache.  I got a complete dud."
4.0,A solid product,"It's so far a solid laptop that I can use for some gaming and school. Just wish my drawing tablet I use for osu worked with it, been having some problems with it."
2.0,Crappy,Screen is dark and not clear. Battery life is terrible and the Laptop runs out of battery and shuts off without giving you enough warning. Speakers are not loud enough. Computer is also pretty slow.
3.0,SLOWWWW!,"Upon using this product for a few months, I think this has been the worst laptop I've ever owned. The processor on this thing drags. Sometimes, start-up takes more than a few minutes. It seems that it's a lot slower than previous laptops I've owned.I'll be typing something into a search bar, and the letters appearing, are slower than me typing them. When I'm streaming videos and try to use the mouse, the cursor is very slow."
5.0,Great quality Lenovo,"Love the laptop; great quality; sent as expected, on time.  Battery life is short, but plugging it in works."
5.0,Great value,I bought these as work laptops for my team and they are great! Clear screen and fast processing. Not very lightweight but a great laptop for the money.
5.0,"Great for steaming and going online, low battery life","Low battery life, but I knew that when I purchased it. Great for streaming, and going online. Havent tried any games."
1.0,Waste of money!,"The worst computer I’ve ever had, total waste of money.  Lenovo support is HORRIBLE and the laptop is glitchy af.  I’ve had to reinstall windows twice with new files from Lenovo and it took almost a year to get it right."
5.0,My favorite PC yet.,"This is my sixth different computer.  It is my third laptop.  It is far and away the best I've ever had.  It is fast, efficient and just seems to look and feel better than previous personal computers."
1.0,Worst computer I have ever bought,"This computer is AWFUL! Do not buy it. It has never worked properly. I had to schedule someone to come out and fix it, which I had to schedule through Lenovo directly and it took weeks. Then after ""fixing"" it, it still runs extremely slow, sounds like an airplane taking off, and is frustrating to use. I have to count my losses and get rid of it, because it is too frustrating to ever use."
1.0,Great laptop windows like always sucks,The machine got stuck in one screen for 3 days updating is not fair for the manufacturer cause no other option but windows updating s:#+$
5.0,Watch who you buy from,Owned for less than 6 months charging cord or port went out computer us useless Ayer battery dies because the only place that sells this unique charger is the company you buy the computer from and they don't respond to emails. It's like once they have your money hey don't care about customer service so I need to try and figure out how to get ahold of someone else to claim the warranty before it runs out which I think they are hoping for. Yes very angry.
5.0,shipping service is real time five star,"ComLenovo Ideapad 15.6"" AMD A12-9720P Quad core processor 2.7GHz, 8GB DDR4, 1TB Hard Drive 5400 rpm. I received it, so slow logon and performance poor too, only the reason HDD 5400rpm. I Changed this 1TB Hard Drive 5400 rpm with Samsung 860 EVO SSD 250GB. Now its running more faster then any Laptop of this catagary. Now can play any latest game on this machine.puter is as mentioned online but shipping service is real time five star"
1.0,Worthless After 6 Months,"Bought 9/18, painfully slow. Needs to be repaired or replaced. 5 mins. + to load Win 10, 5 mins. to load ANY program."
5.0,Happy with purchase of this item,A lot of good features for the price but as with most electronics battery life after 6 months is an issue.
4.0,Techie Approved,Very good computer.. easy to use.. battery lasts for quite sometime... navigates well.. nice computer for responsible grade school child. Highly recommend..
1.0,You should consider a different laptop,"It is way too slow, it took me 4 hrs to configure it initially, which included changing the language to Spanish; opening any application takes 2 to 3 seconds, and unacceptable lag. I could have spent time tuning, but found out later that the battery lasts only 2 to 3.5 hours. I'm sure that the HD 5400 RPM, is a major factor on the performance, if you are okay with the poor battery life, upgrade to an SSD drive."
5.0,PC  to go along side my Mac,I needed a PC to rum some programs my Mac Book Pro won't run. It's not real fast and it doesn't have a lot of storage. But it suits me for now.
1.0,worst computer ever!!!!,I have owned computers since windows 3.1 came out. This thing has a horrible battery life and is probably the slowest computer I have ever had. The most complex thing that I use this thing for is bill pay and simple web sites. it gets very frustrating waiting 3-5 minutes to open a site.  DO NOT BUY.  I am 55 years old and this is my first review ever written. Hopefully this will help you!!!
1.0,"Didn't drop it, didn't get it wet. Can't find the serial number to check the warranty. Super bummed.","I've only had this laptop for 3 months, and it's dead. I can't check my warranty because the laptop doesn't have a serial number on it. I can't return the laptop to Amazon because it's been more than a month. I am out $353. Super sad."
5.0,Runs great,Very happy. Sleek design. Can even handle some games.
5.0,Great laptop,"I don't ask much of a laptop so I am happy with it. It's fast, connects quickly to wifi, and the screen is quite nice. Thanks!"
5.0,Well Engineered and Designed. FAST,This laptop is well engineered and designed. It is fast. Browsing on the internet is relatively fast and trouble free. Lots of storage.
1.0,Terrible buy,the feathers came off when I got it out of the package. Wore them for a few hours and I had to throw them away because the feathers fall off and you could see the cardboard.
5.0,Five Stars,Fantastic computer.
5.0,Easy set up,Just received this and it was so easy to set up!  So far great product..can’t comment on the battery as I’ll keep it plugged in.  The cord did get a little warm so I will be checking that it.
5.0,Good size and quality,Bit slow on boot up but is very helpful in my line of work. Makes checking my email allot easier than my phone
