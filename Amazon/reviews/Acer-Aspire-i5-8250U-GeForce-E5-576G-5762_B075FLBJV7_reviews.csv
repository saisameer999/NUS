5.0,"A Review from an average guy, (not a ""techy"")","I wish I could have read a review from an average person who doesn't work on computers for a living, or isn't a full time gaming nut.  So here it is:"
2.0,"5 Star Value - Only If It Works Reliably Though - Probably Not For ""Power Users""","I've had this laptop for close to a month. I'm self-employed in the IT Industry for 30 years and  know computers inside nad out.  I'm also super frugal but I am a power user (20 browser windows open, Photoshop, Video Editing, sometimes CAD) NO GAMING though but gaming machines work well for my purpose.  This is a mid-range laptop as far as gaming - if you're really into gaming you should be getting a laptop with a NVIDIA 1050 GPU and an Intel Processor with H at the end of the model instead of U.  More power, but less battery life. This unit is a great compromise between powerful CPU and GPU with good battery life.  It's a fantastic value if you are not one of the unlucky ones to run into issues.  I wasn't so lucky and am returning it."
5.0,Substance Over Style,"I received this laptop promptly.  I was beating myself up with all the choices.  What I finally decided was that this one was really my only option.  I wanted all the features this offers.  Great battery life, a matte screen (non-glossy) full HD, an SSD vs the HDD drive, and a backlit keyboard.  This laptop as mentioned by others will not win any style points.  It will however win with substance. It still is nice looking with a textured cover and being black overall.  But that is not what this one is about.  Its about what is inside of this amazing product.  It took me about an hour to get all the updates to get it current.  It boots up in 10 seconds and shuts down in 2 to 3 seconds. The screen quality is excellent, and I am fussy due to my interest in digital imagery.  It opens programs immediately.  I like the idea that the keyboard lights up and has a ""time out"" feature to shut off.  It also works with the battery where my older ACER did not. That one had to be plugged in for the keyboard to light up.  I can tell you for web surfing, the battery life is on par with what is advertised.  I bought this primarily to surf the web and to edit digital images.  I may play SIMS 4.  I do not think I will need to upgrade the RAM.  I will however be looking into adding a second storage drive at some point.  If you are on the fence about buying this, go for it.  Its amazing.  One more note.  Do not even consider a laptop with an HDD drive vs. an SSD.  You will already be behind the times.  The difference is incredible.  Acer made a winner here!!  I am a very happy customer!"
5.0,Fantastic machine at an affordable price!,"""She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've made a lot of special modifications myself. """
5.0,As good as you'll find for 600 dollars... trust me.,"My search for the perfect laptop began 6 months ago and nothing has changed since then. No new technologies have rendered others obsolete or pushed prices down. The same laptops still cost the same amount. I first started in the 300 dollar range since I only needed the laptop for writing books and background music. In fact, the less it could do the better, because then I couldn't get distracted so easily. I quickly learned that laptops in that price range could barely function as laptops. They either didn't have hard drives or had such weak CPUs that opening a Word document was a complex task requiring several hours and a battery recharge. The best laptop in that range was the 350 dollar little brother of this one, but to make it worth it, you had to upgrade the RAM and the hard drive, bumping the price up to around 550."
1.0,"Became unresponsive after less than three months, Acer won't do anything about it.",The computer worked flawlessly up until it randomly shut off one day and became unresponsive. I've owned it for a little over two and a half months so naturally I was upset. When I sent it back to Acer to repair it they simply claimed it had water damaging and couldn't fix it. Instead they offered to sell my a replacement for the same cost of the original. I'm very careful and very strict about keeping liquids away from my electronic devices. I'm very upset with how the company has dealt with this issue. I will not be buying an Acer again.
4.0,Surprisingly decent laptop,Hello.
5.0,Warning! Not all reviews here are for the same laptop!,My laptop model is E5-576G-5762. If you are purchasing any other model this review is not relevant.
1.0,"A monumental, huge, epic fail on every possible level","I read reviews on screens going black, rendering the computer useless. Crossed fingers and ordered anyway. Huge mistake. Yep, it happened to me, and at the worst time possible (as if there is ever a good time), when a big snowstorm hit and I needed to work from home. I'm writing this after eking my way to the office through ice and snow. When I'm finished being angry about that, I'll turn to being angry about the work product that I've lost forever."
2.0,My screen now has numerous horizontal and vertical white bands ...,"My screen now has numerous horizontal and vertical white bands making it impossible to use the laptop. Acer refused to pay for shipping it back to them for warranty repairs. California law mandates that products shipped to California customers must have free shipping for warranty repairs over-riding whatever the manufacturer puts in their warranty agreements. After spending over 30 min on the phone with their supervisors, Acer finally agreed to pay for shipping as ""one-time courtesy"" even though it was their obligation under the California law. Hope your states have a similar law on the books protecting you from such scavengers."
5.0,Good machine -- buy the correct RAM memory if upgrading.,"E5-576G model.  Best PC bang for this level of buck.  I saw lots of good reviews and I concur. So far I am pleasantly impressed with this unit, however I have not used it a long time or tested many applications to date..  I am upgrading with a second storage disk (HD not SSD) and more memory.  To perhaps help some avoid confusion the memory upgrade: There are two RAM memory slots in the laptop, and it comes shipped from Acer with 1 slot filled with 8GB.  (By piecing together numerous incomplete Acer replies and posts from Acer) -- The RAM memory supported by the E5-576G model is 32GB maximum (2x16) DDR3L 1600Mhz memory 1.35v SODIMM Laptop.  DDR3L memory is low voltage ( L=1.3v )  Acer (incorrectly?) posted memory as having 260-pins -- I believe that Acer post is wrong and should be 204-pins.  This was very confusing and took a while to figure out.  I ordered the wrong memory twice and one commenter lead me astray by recommending the wrong memory -- perhaps their post was not for the E5-576G model?  To the best of my knowledge this 8GB of Kingston memory is the specification that is correct for the E5-576G. ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B5SKK78?tag=wwwkingstonco-20 )  I have not found any matching 16GB single sticks (1x16) available anywhere -- only 8GB.  The photo attached is the 8GB memory stick that ACER delivered with the PC."
5.0,"Incredible laptop - full package, great price","I have been beyond pleased with this laptop purchase over the last 6 months of use. I can certainly say this is the best laptop I've ever had (but then again I've only had 3, and you would expect these things to improve over time, right). I purchased the Acer Aspire E 15, 15.6"" E5-576G-5762 laptop with 8th Gen Intel Core i5-8250U, GeForce MX150, 8GB RAM Memory, and 256GB SSD. I highly recommend this laptop for anyone looking for a great performing machine with an outstanding price (just to be clear, it won't be running the newest high-end games on ultra-high graphics settings, but it still performs phenomenally for its price range and usage category)."
1.0,Monitor went out after 1 month.,"Monitor went out 35 days after receiving. Dropped my son off at college 8 hours away. Didn't take box laptop was shipped in as it's a new product right?, opted for Amazon Basic protector case. What a mistake. 5 days too late for Amazon Warranty, 2 months too early for Square Trade Warranty, Acer will take a look if you send it back on your dime. Great freakin' great. Small college town, son having problems getting packed correctly for insurance. What a hassle... Out $700. plus probably another $40. for return shipping. Meanwhile my son has no laptop for his summer classes."
1.0,Battery Problems,"My Acer Aspire e 15  worked great for a day, and then shut off by itself.  Called tech support and they had me reset the computer by pushing paper clip in pinhole in back of computer...That seemed to correct problem, but problem returned next day and the battery would only charge up to 1% with charger plugged in . I had to keep charger plugged in to use a new computer...Acer I think you have a track record with battery problems with this computer.. Please note I contacted Amazon for a refund and I returned the defective computer for a quick refund---thank you Amazon....."
5.0,Great Laptop Value,"I bought this mostly for my wife to use (net surfing, email), but wanted a machine with enough power to run CAD and GIS software.  This laptop fills the bill."
1.0,Keyboard stopped working; warranty doesn't include return postage,"Purchased this laptop in January 2018.  By June 2018, the keyboard stopped working, and I had to do an unplug and reboot.  That solved the problem for a few weeks, then both CTRL keys stopped working.  No reboot resolved it, and within a couple weeks, the keyboard once again stopped working and the unplug reboot did nothing.  I called tech support, and they guided me through a battery reset, which got the keyboard working but not the CTRL keys.  They have offered to replace the keyboard (which is covered by the warranty for which they have the wrong purchase date), but they will not cover postage for the submission for repairs.  So my cost for the computer has gone up, and I have a faulty computer that has already required a major part replacement.  I will NEVER purchase an ACER computer again, and lesson learned on purchasing such items through Amazon, without the ability to return it to a store and avoid having to pay more money for a problem that I did not cause."
1.0,Just got it today. Powered it on and did ...,Just got it today. Powered it on and did all the updates. Powered it down and back up a few time to check boot times and now ibhave huge black lines running down the screen.
1.0,purchased this new and with high expectations. We have ...,purchased this new and with high expectations. We have been using it for about a month. While the computer starts up and runs quickly we are experiencing frequent crashes. While browsing or completing basic tasks the screen goes black and the only solution is to hold the power button down until it turns off. The is very frustrating and disappointing! I have only installed Microsoft office and the driver for my printer so this should not be happening after 1 month!
1.0,Unreliable,"Display driver fails 3X a day.  Loses Wifi connection every hour. Sometimes won't boot.  I bought two of them, installed all BIOS and driver updates. They are simply unreliable, poorly made laptops."
4.0,This laptop has great hardware for its price!!!,This laptop has an amazing price for the hardware it offers. Some laptops have sold for more than twice the price of this laptop with similar hardware.
1.0,Ongoing hardware issues,"Update 2/4/2019: I had to ship this unit back to Acer for repair in 2018 because the screen appeared to stop functioning after upgrading Windows 10 Pro to version 1803. Online research showed quite a few people having same type issues. When I got the unit back it had a nasty scratch on the lid, but did function. Now the same thing has happened again ... screen goes black. For the first repair the Acer (no charge) invoice indicated they replaced the mainboard. I am a technically savvy person, been in IT for 20 years as a programmer and database administrator.  There appears to some issue with this particular design that causes this issue to reappear. This latest time happened after the unit remained plugged in for several hours. The battery was fully charged at some point during being plugged in. Power saving option was set to let the screen go blank after an hour, but not to go to sleep for 5 hours. The unit was not in sleep mode but screen was blank and would not respond.  Took multiple resets from pinhole in bottom of unit and taking off of electrical power to get the screen back up.  Needless to say, hard resets to windows platforms are not good. This model has some issue with AC power, and sleep mode. I have hibernation turned off, always do after bad experiences in any laptop I've owned. The only plus I've found in this unit is it does have a long battery life."
1.0,UPDATED Don’t buy this computer!! AGAIN!!,I’m a pretty patient person and don’t post negative reviews without trying to resolve the problem. This computer has been a very big problem that I haven’t yet satisfactorily solved. About one week after purchase the computer would not start. Acer  customer service is terrible. After an hour on the phone we got the computer to start. I should have returned it immediately. A couple weeks later it did the same thing. The rep had me poke a paper clip in a little hole and then it started up. Worked for a few days. Another frustrating customer service call. The rep had a heavy accent and spoke so fast I couldn’t understand him. Asked him to slow down. He didn’t. He got annoyed because I had to ask him to repeat himself. This time we had to poke a paper clip in a little hole and then do a factory reset. Working again. For about a week. Now it is out for repair. We’ll see what the future holds.
4.0,"Solid PC, better keyboard, but a little noisy",I bought an Acer Aspire E 15 two years ago.
2.0,Nice machine but latest model has hardware color display issue.,"This is specifically for the E5-576G-5762.  I had previously bought two 575G's and by and large liked them price to performance wise, but they where updated to the 576G model and they have a serious flaw.  The color is off.  Now keep in mind that I tried color calibration, updating both the intel and nvidia drivers with what acer has on their site as well as the latest from the intel and nvidia site.  Not just a little bit too.  I spend hours on these things and I am someone who has 28 years in tech roles with an MCSE.  In addition I had returned the first one and bought another and it had the exact same issue and tried to remediate again.  I am sure at this is an issue across the model at this point.  To be more specific on the issue the most noticable thing is that reds appear orange.  So for example the youtube symbol seems orange.  It more clear when using a test image like http://krazyblog.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/6291.png .  This is not an issue with the previous model.  Both my 575G's the colors on that chart show right but on the 576G's the red is orange, when the blocks should become purple they stay blue and the other colors are noticeably off.  This is made all the more of a shame given the newer model has blacker blacks and better contrast, but that is no good if the color is incorrect.  Again I have tried modifications to contrast, hue, saturation.  I have tried other color profiles.  Its a hardware issue.  Now given that without the issue they are a nice laptop.  Good performance for the price and my intention as the support for my family was to have everyone on these with a spare to deal with ones that break down.  Alas this new model is a non starter.  Too bad.  BTW I was thinking of adding a picture of the laptops side by side with the image, but given my garbage old camera phone you really can't see it in a picture of the display properly.  Maybe if I had a better camera that would be possible but not with what I got."
4.0,Great laptop with very flimsy screen.,"An excellent laptop as previously described by other reviewers.  I will furthermore say that it runs great with Windows 10 and all updates available at the date of this review.  I did, of course, install all BIOS and driver updates provided by Acer."
1.0,Slows down when charging,"I like almost everything about this laptop. It feels durable, looks sleek and runs smoothly. I can even use it to run graphic heavy games such as The Witcher 3."
1.0,"SSD crashed a few months in.  Data loss, lack of quality.","Laptop was purchased as a new computer for my mother so she would have a better machine.  Additionally, being new, it would require me to perform LESS ""IT Support"".  Registry errors occurred after just a few months and the SSD had to be wiped and everything reinstalled.  I have had to provide more IT support than I did with her Toshiba laptop circa 2012.  I would have to describe their quality control as lax."
1.0,4 months later it won't turn on,Bought this laptop in May 2018. Then in September it stopped turning on. Eventually got it to start again then it happened again. Amazon said go through Acer for warranty support.
5.0,"Good work laptop, but Microsoft is extra sleazy",I'm a freelancer and I work on this laptop.
4.0,Nice computer with weak technical support,"Computer (Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576G-5762) gets 5 stars, but technical support does not know much about it. Wanted to find out what the capacity of the additional 2.5-inch hard drive bay is. Will it accept a 1 TB SSD drive? Or is it limited to 512 GB? Tried onine chat, tech support number and ""answer back"" service. None of these source even knew that the computer has a second drive bay! They told me that the existing 256 GB SSD (M.2) drive could be replaced with a 512 GB M.2 drive. Clearly there is a second, available drive bay on this model. Based on reviewer comments, it looks like a 512 GB SATA SSD can be added (2.5 inch) or a larger capacity conventional disk drive (up to 1 TB) can be added. But I was hoping to get confirmation from the manufacturer. There is nothing in the manual, system specs or Acer support website about this. Maybe the manufacturer could provide some help here. (User comments welcome too!)"
5.0,Best Value Business Laptop Out There,"My first requirement for a new business laptop was a DVD drive - has it. Next I needed an HD IPS display - has it. Wanted an 8th generation Intel i5 processor - yup. Needed at least 8gb of ram - included. Had to have a fast SSD instead of the traditional mechanical drive - 256GB M.2 drive included! Bonus - 2 USB 3.1, 1 VGA (yes I often need this), 1 USB 3.1 Type-C, LED-lighted display, discrete graphics card and webcam. This laptop has worked fantastic thus far after having taken it on a couple business trips."
5.0,Amazing laptop for the price,"My in-laws tasked me with finding them a laptop to buy their daughters, and I came across this one in my searches. I thought the price point, industry views, and hardware included was so amazing that I ended up buying me one 5 months ago. Then 4 months later, we bought 2 more for my in-law's daughters. It's safe for me to say that I think this laptop is pretty amazing at this price point, especially considering I was initially looking at some $800-1000 comparable ones."
1.0,defected screen- asked me to pay $300 to repair,"When i bought the laptop, everything was fine for the beginning,, right around the 2nd month, i have noticed there is a dot in the top corner of the screen and slowly started to expand and hairline across the screen.  I have contacted the support, sent my unit out for repair since I believe this is a product defect .  The support from Acer called me today,  told me this is not covered by their warranty, asked me if i want to pay $300 to repair the system."
4.0,Overheats in moderate gaming. Suspect bad thermal paste. Great so far.,"Great laptop right out of the box. Latest gen Intel CPU, and Nvidia GPU for a neat $599.99. I'm moving on from an 7 year old Asus so I wanted to keep my HDD from the previous laptop. Overheats during high-speed games like CS:GO and Blacklight. Considering replacing thermal paste with higher quality compound."
1.0,Not durable,"In about 8 months of ownership, the power charger died (was warrantied) and now the upper portion of the screen has become dim. Acer will not warranty the screen because they consider it 'physical damage.' It went dim while I was using it in bed, the laptop never leaves the house, and has never been dropped or hit."
1.0,Quit after less than six months,"Computer has great specs (reviewed elsewhere) and when it worked, was great. Pretty snappy, lots of storage, had everything I needed. Bought in September 2018, battery stopped charging in February 2019. Battery and connections all fine but no more charging. So, basically a $600 brick. The stars for material quality, sound quality and battery life are based on when the computer was working. I gave it one star overall for dying this fast. I agree with the positive reviews given by others but (after my Acer died) I have also seen several places online where the problem with the battery not charging is talked about."
1.0,Has a lot of problems,My son was so excited to get his laptop. The first one the a key was broken. The second one the volume stopped working. I’m not trying a third one.
3.0,"Laptop performs well, but the battery has issues.","I would like to say that when this laptop works, it performs very well and I am very pleased in that respect. However, there is the glaring problem of the battery. Basically, if you leave this laptop plugged in when it is fully charged (i.e. if you charge it overnight or any other time for more than 2 hours in general), it is almost guaranteed to crash when you use it next. The screen will freeze, and the only solution is to force shutdown, do a battery reset, and then turn it back on. Thankfully, this is a pretty easy process once you get used to following the steps, but its ridiculous to have to do anything like this on a regular basis. I've owned mine for about 2 months, and I've had to reset it in this manner between five and ten times. The worst part was that I didn't know this was a simple issue in the beginning. Initially, I assumed that my laptop simply had a factory defect, which it indeed does, whose only solution was replacement. This caused me to go through the entire process of shipping my first laptop back in order to get a refund."
1.0,which also had an annoying problem. First of all,"This is more of an issue with Acer customer support than this particular laptop, which also had an annoying problem."
4.0,Great HD / Non-glare screen / backlit keyboard,"24-hour review, out of the box:  Updates, you know how Windows is. Depending on your internet speeds will determine how long this takes. Computer will restart itself during updates. I bought this for media and usage of games. Upon wanting to play a game, game seemed to start but instantly closed itself. A pop-up appeared from Windows in the corner - ""...fix apps that are blurry on your desktop..."" I had some research to do, because the laptop would not allow me to play any video games."
1.0,"1st & 2nd arrived DOA, will be looking at other options.  Amazon has been amazing as always.",The first one I ordered had half a row of dead pixels right in the middle of the screen.
5.0,Hard to beat for most users,"I use this computer at home, not for gaming or heavy duty processing.  After about 3 months of use I'd strongly recommend this machine to a friend.  If you're the ""IT person"" for your parents / grandparents this would be a great machine to recommend to them as it's fairly cheap and easy to operate."
5.0,Great Computer for an Amazing Price,"Great computer for the price. There’s an expansion 2.5” bay for another drive so I added an SSD. There’s also another RAM slot that’s open. I have gone a week with this thing unplugged on standby and it still had 4 hours of battery left. I watched a 2 hour long movie, once I finished I had 8 hours of life to do normal operations (surf internet, program in python, things like that. The speakers are incredible. My only complaint is the outside of the case. It’s look great but feels like cheap plastic, but it seems to be very durable. There’s plenty IO ports to connect to anything really, except DVI and a Display Port. Overall great computer, way better than my old one. The start up time from being completely turned off to loading my desktop was around 12 seconds. Getting another computer with these same specs would have cost around $800+ as far as I could see."
5.0,Incredibly fast (i7-8550U model),"Bought this for 3D CAD purposes at work. The performance of the new 8th generation quad-core i7 chip is incredible for a laptop. I ran Intel's stress test, which maxes out the CPU for a few minutes, and temperatures never got above 63C, so I know my hands aren't going to be getting sweaty. That's a testament to the low power draw (maximum of 25 watts) and the large cooling setup that is visible at the intake port on the underside of the laptop and at the exhaust port. On top of that, the solid-state drive is noticeably fast. Booting up the laptop is <10 seconds. The latest Windows 10 feature update installed very quickly as well."
4.0,Recommend,Core i7-8550U
3.0,Old laptop design with up-to-date components,"I purchased the i5 version of this laptop, w/ the 256gb NVMe SSD. I knew going in that Acer makes a very cheap feeling laptop, and the touchpads are trash! I went ahead and purchased because of the base system components at this price point."
2.0,Graphics are fine while the computer works and the backlit keyboard was ...,Graphics are fine while the computer works and the backlit keyboard was great. I've purchased 4 Acer or Asus laptops from Amazon and they have all been DOA. With the latest one the battery wouldn't retain a charge and the computer would not run unless it was plugged into the wall. I sent it to the Acer repair facility where they swapped out the battery but were not very thorough in diagnosing the problem because the laptop was shipped back to me and had the same issues. I probably won't ever buy an Acer or an Asus again.
1.0,What an amazing (not) experience,The speaker didn't work first. Fix it with the warranty in a couple of weeks. When I got it back I realize I DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT BEING PLUGGED TO THE POWER CORD! The battery is dead and the laptop was brand new. Immediately requested a refund. What an amazing (not) experience.
1.0,second time sending in for repair.,"This computer seemed fine. Until it needed to be sent in for repair. The first time the screen froze. Spent almost $40 to send it in and it was a pain to find a box for it to fit in as well as the time spent trying to get it working again. This time the wireless adapter isn't working so again, time spent trouble shooting and now sending it in. I am glad it is still under the 1st year warranty for a couple more months (although I was so busy I didn't even have a chance to open the box and start using it for a couple weeks after it arrived). This is the first and last Acer brand computer I will ever buy. I bought it new off Amazon and it wasn't cheap."
1.0,Avoid this computer and this manufacturer,"I have now owned my laptop for 2 months and I have had a couple of issues. It worked fine for the first 7weeks, but then the screen started going black and all I could see was the cursor. The only way to get an image back is to reboot the computer."
1.0,JUNK!,Bought one of these and had to return/replace. It had a greyish white line running across screen which I didn't notice unless there was a black background. I saw that other people were having that same problem. I was afraid it would get worse if I didn't return it so had it replaced. Replacement came in promptly. I set it up and used it less than a dozen times and one morning it just died and would not turn on. I hooked up battery charger and still would not come on. Had been using it a few minutes before that happened. Have no idea why it died. Especially given I had it less than 30 days and only used it less than a dozen times!  Would NEVER buy another Acer.
1.0,"Genuinely Poor Performance, Only Suitable for Minimal Tasks","Some Background: I am a software engineer and I bought this laptop to use for side projects.  I did not need a machine that had very high-specs because I had no intention of running intensive applications (aka video editing, games, etc).  I am still deeply disappointed."
5.0,"Amazing laptop, but please update Acer graphics driver.","So far, its everything I wanted in a laptop. Sure, a bit of a lighter laptop would be cool, but its difficult to find a SSD with quad cores and a sweet GPU. This laptop starts up instantly and has lightning fast download capabilities. I've only had it for a few days, but it puts my old laptop to shame. Backlit keyboard as well."
1.0,Worthless laptop & customer service,"I called for help probably a month after purchase because when it went to sleep it would never come on again. The rep told me I needed to stick up a pin in a little hole on the back of the computer blah blah blah. Couldn't believe I had to start a new computer in that Yahoo manner!  When I called once more a couple of weeks later  the rep admitted there was something definitely wrong with the computer and that I should send it back and receive it in a couple of weeks. I work from home and could not do that. That's the only solution he had for me even though it was a brand new computer! Now 5 months later my motherboard has to be replaced and my ""window"" is closed!!! Save your money and get something other than Acer"
4.0,"Reasonalble Priced functionality with speed, compatibility, and some expansion capacity.","https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075FLBJV7/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 was delivered a few days ago. I put together an order based on reviews that included other things I knew I would likely need.  I have had ""issues"" with touchpads over the years, and a portable mouse with a pre-linked usb radio cost only $10.  I have now got the machine set up and mostly integrated into my two desktop and now ""portable"" little home network as well as a larger wireless network here at @Kendal at Oberlin where I'm a volunteer Tech Support dispatch and service provider for a community of about 325, all ""seniors"" living in a CCRC and mostly ""here for the duration.""  I needed something to be my ""brain"" and ""test bench"" machine that had all the usual connectors, could easily work with ""Training Center"" smart screen devices, and support programming projects which include conference room where taking notes and demonstrating functionality or getting code reviews can be helpful."
3.0,The battery is pretty good too,"This computer is really fast. You can probably go from ""on"" to the internet in about 10 seconds. This is because it is a solid state drive (SSD). The battery is pretty good too."
5.0,"Well-made, fast, backlit & good-feel keyboard, matte display, USB 3 & USB C ports, HDMI & VGA,",I liked virtually everything!
5.0,Best bang for your buck!!,"I hate to just give 5 stars all the way for this laptop but I just have to do it. For the price you pay and what you receive it is worth every penny. One of the absolute best values on a laptop!! It is very responsive, battery life is excellant. Wife was doing her homework and watching Netflix on it at the same time (don't ask me how she manages that cause I have no idea) and after three hours of it still had over 80% battery. The screen gives a good image. Keyboard is of acceptable quality. Just can't really say anything bad about it. Obviously things aren't top notch on this laptop but you're not paying for top notch either. Can you play games on this? Absolutely but not without compromise. I wouldn't buy this laptop expecting to pay intensive games. That is not what it was built for because in that sense if you knew about pcs at all you would be looking for a minimum of a GTX 1050. So keep in mind this is a gaming laptop. All being said though I truly believe this is the best value laptop on the market. If your looking to do some medium duty multitasking mixed with light gaming then this is the laptop for you."
4.0,Review from a casual user,"I got this laptop for netflix, email/surfing and some gaming.  I can say that the graphics are pretty good, but the battery doesn't last 12 hours as the description claims.  I get about 5 hours out of it when just surfing, etc.  If I watch netflix I get about 3 hours and if I play Civilization VI It'll run for an hour.  The keyboard is backlit...but only while typing. A few seconds after you stop, the keyboard goes dark. It plays most of the games I like from Steam, but I have to plug in the power cord."
1.0,Battery life is awful,Worked for a couple days then stopped holding a charge.
5.0,Great Valve and Peformace for $600.,"Acers E5-576G-5762 I love this laptop, especially for $600. This the best value in laptop computer in the market today. The Intel 8th generation I-5 8250u 8th Gen  14 nm is 4 core and 8 threads and is within 10 percent of the I -7, which cost $150 more. It's speed goes from 1.6ghz to turbo boast to 3.4 GHZ. The primary Hard Drive is a M.2 style  motherboard mount SSD 250 GB, and this leaves an empty space for an addition  2.5 inch SSD or HDD. It has a CD/DVD burner which is rare nowadays. It has a Backlit keyboard. HD 1920 X 1080 display. It has 2 DDR3 ram slot with (1) 8 GB DDR 3 1600 Ram stick installed, which has Timing 11-11-11 CAS 11. This  allows an additional 8 GB 1600 CAS 11 stick of laptop ram.Just buy  DDR 3 1600  with 11 11 11 CAS 11 timing. The 2.5 Hard drive space, ram slots and M.2 are accessible by removing only 3 screws and easily pop the cover off the bottom, which I Love . I already add a 4 GB memory CAS 11 Ram left over from another broken laptop and installed with no trouble. I plan on adding a 2 TB HHD for $80 latter. The NVIDIA 1030 with 2 GB of DDR 5 video is a great valve as a low end gaming laptop."
5.0,the best laptop I've ever had,"I read reviews for a couple of weeks before purchasing this computer. I started looking at the similar HP that was priced at 650, but one reviewer mentioned that they bought the Acer for $100 less... so here I am."
2.0,Disappointing and unreliable,I've had this laptop for about 9 months now and have been disappointed for two main reasons:
1.0,do not recommend,purchased in October 2018 based on reviews
4.0,Great laptop with a terrible hard drive bay,"Excellent performing laptop for the price.  Great for casual gaming, or general use."
3.0,Beware of Acer Quality,"I've been generally pleased with this computer. My only real gripe is that the screen is dim, but I spend most of my time with it hooked up to external monitors."
3.0,Powerhouse Performance With Major Flaws,"This labtop is a powerhouse, but has some major flaws. The most serious issue is the tracking pad, which can instantly be noticed when sizing up (dragging) a screenshot (touch pad lag). The pad also just stops responding, when doing something as simple as right click,or tapping the center, this happened to me regularly when I had to click and tap multiple times. Seems Acer could have installed a much better touch pad. Like other users,  I also experienced a couple random shutdowns. Acer also installed ddr3l instead of ddr4, which they do not state clearly state in the description. Lastly, the battery is not user accessible , leading to costly repairs down the road. If Acer addresses these issues, I will gladly purchase the next model, as the performance is top notch, but the issues I've laid out here are nearly impossible to overlook."
5.0,"Fast, efficient, powerful, and quiet!","Wow. I bought this computer because I’m teaching myself web development, and I wanted a computer that was dedicated just for coding. Some tech website had this computer as the editor’s choice for best coding/programming computer of 2018, and man - I’m glad I bought this!"
1.0,"piece of junk, poor support, buy a dell or an hp - broken now for two months of owning it",DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP!  ACER WILL NOT STAND BY THEIR PRODUCT...IT WAS SENT BACK AFTER A MONTH DUE TO THE SCREEN NOT COMING ON.  THEY HAD THE UNIT FOR TWO WEEKS AND I JUST OPENED IT TO FIND THAT IT WAS NOT FIXED AND IS EXPERIENCING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM OF NO SCREEN.  THEY SAY WARRANTY WILL NOT PROVIDE REPLACEMENT OF THE UNIT AND I NEED TO SEND IT BACK.
5.0,What you need to know before upgrading RAM,"I have a different Acer laptop for the past 9 years and it's still going strong after upgrading HDD to SSD, replaced keyboard and battery pack 2 times. It's fine for some basic web browsing. However, the battery life was 2.5 hours at most because the old components aren't as power efficient as todays. Therefore, I began my search for the next budget friendly Acer Laptop. My requirements were long battery life, able to upgrade RAM and HDD easily, and computing power (in this order). I decided on Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576G-5762 (i5-5250U, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM, MX150) after much research because it ticked all the boxes."
5.0,"Fast, works great, Upgradeability","As I type this review using this specific laptop for about a month. I have no regrets, and is a great affordable laptop that fits my needs. Its the best ""bang for your buck"". I only wished it had a touchscreen but it doesn't take away what it can do as is. Amazon was great in shipping and delivery, and Acer gave me a great laptop for everyday use with a bit more power for occasional gaming and workloads in short intervals. I added an extra 8gb ram and the computer recognized it instantly. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an everyday use/home laptop/student/entry level job laptop. The convenience for optional upgradeability is also a plus. My only small issues for me is that the screen is matted finish, so the brightness is not as ideal as I would like it to be so I leave it usually on max brightness. And it is made of plastic but still well built and understandable within the price range, also it would be nice if there were control settings to turn on or off the backlight of the keyboard. Keyboard is also great and having a number pad is nice to have as well, along with having a internal optical drive, newer laptops are removing it entirely to save space and reduce weight and you can always get a external dvd/cd drive. All in all it is a great product."
2.0,Bad power button,"This Acer works well enough, but six months after purchasing it and using it normally, the power button has begun to fail. I have trouble getting the machine to turn back on. It turns out that, based on internet research, other users have experienced a similar problem with this model. The power button is fickle: sometimes it works fine, but twice now it has simply refused to turn on."
4.0,Pretty Amazing Value for Money,"For those that might not know, $600 is an unusually low price for a gaming laptop, especially one of decent quality, but the Aspire E15 honestly shocked me. I've been using it since August and have had no major technical issues thus far, but it seems like quite a few people have had the opposite experience, so I may have just gotten lucky. However, I can't deny that this laptop runs most games better than other, more expensive computers I've tried in the past. Games such as Overwatch, Civilization, DOTA 2, and even Rainbow Six: Siege run surprisingly well, with smooth framerates and solid resolutions on medium/high graphics. Even if you’re not using it for games, the laptop loads other taxing programs such as Photoshop and Adobe Premiere fairly quickly, and has a very long battery life of up to 12 hours in my experience."
1.0,Screen problems with this model (two different laptops),"I ordered this laptop for the first time in January. Within a week of using it, the screen had a section that turned gray and then started flickering. Luckily, at that time, I was in the return window at Amazon and they shipped a new laptop to me. Once I received the new laptop, I returned the old one. No problems. Enjoyed the laptop until today. My laptop (now two months old) has just started the same problem with a large section of the screen going gray and then now flickering. Now, I'm outside the Amazon return window and am having to ship the 2 month old laptop to an Acer Repair Center. Honestly, I don't want my two month old laptop to even need repairs. Frankly, I just want my money back and to buy a different laptop at this point. I have no confidence that a THIRD device is not going to have the same problems."
4.0,Nice Upgrade,"I bought this laptop to replace/upgrade an earlier model that I bought 3 years before, which replaced another that lasted 2 years. The first one got a virus and it was cheaper to replace. The last one works fine, but the power cord broke. Also, all but one port are totally useless. Instead of a new power cord, I decided it was time to upgrade. I’m glad I did! This one has exactly what the previous model didn’t. Much better graphics and a backlit keyboard. It’s fast, tho I only have 2 programs on it. It’s great for light gaming (SL) and using MS Office. I just bought it and will update my review if anything changes. If you’re considering this one, I’d recommend it. It’s the least expensive and best rated of comparable items. I hope it lasts more than 3 years."
4.0,Fast Computer - Good for the Price!,"Let me start out this review by mentioning that I am not a gamer but have a high wpm rate (~90wpm) and have a hard time with laptops not keeping up. I purchased this laptop April 2nd, 2019 after playing the which-computer-can-actually-keep-up game since my Acer E15 (E5-575G-57D4) bit the dust the end of December 2018. I'd purchased that laptop refurbished in July 2017. Since January 2019 I have purchased the following (in sequential order based on stellar user reviews): Dell G5 [~$800, from Walmart - G5587-7037] - this laptop lagged and the cooling fans were super loud - I returned it within 2 weeks when I had an issue with lagging and the keys on the keyboard would sometimes get stuck; Acer E15 E5-576G-81GD refurbished [~$618, from acerrecertified dot com, ) - I wanted this laptop to be THE ONE but after 10 days of use the screen turned black and it wouldn't boot up (no luck connecting it via HDMI either) [Acer's tech support gave option to send it in to be fixed (I'd have to pay shipping cost to them) or send it back for full refund with free shipping so I sent it back for refund]; and an Acer Aspire desktop [~$450 via Amazon with tax, TC-865-NESelecti3] - this one kept up without any issues but I decided that I was too used to laptop versatility so I gifted this one to my mom since her desktop recently went out. I've had this E5-576G-81GD (~$730 NEW w/ tax from Amazon) for 11 days now (as of today) and it has had no issues keeping up, the battery lasts a long time, the fan is super quiet and I haven't had any glitches as of this time (knock on wood). I did notice a dead pixel today upon windows startup but aside from this single dead pixel I have nothing negative to note. The backlit keyboard is a fabulous feature on these E15 models (I'd gifted two of the E5-575G models previously mentioned above to two friends over the past years and they have not had issues with theirs). I love these E15/E5 models WHEN THEY WORK PROPERLY but it's concerning when there seem to be a good number of duds also. Based on my research and the specs I need vs pricing I've found these to be the best bang for your buck but just hope we can get more than one year out of them without issues! Hopefully Acer will find the root of the issues and fix them to allow a trustworthy laptop!"
5.0,AMAZING SUPER FAST!!!!,"I've only had this product for 1 day but let me say straight out of the box this laptop has lived up to every positive review on the internet and trust me I did weeks of research on every laptop out there.  It is so super fast, there's no toggling between websites, web pages don't freeze, the keys don't stick & I love the way the keys light up when touched. The resolution quality is so amazing. The colors in my photos seem so vibrant.  Set up was breeze and there's not a lot of bloatware on the computer.  There is a place for more storage but I haven't added any yet.  Don't let the price deter you, you get more than you pay for. It's also amazingly quite and  does not over heat or even gets hot. I downloaded close to 2,000 photos & videos in 5 min from 3 different sources all connected to the laotop at the same time. I traded this one for a more expensive brand new crappy HP laptop with Intel Pentium & is was soooo slow, everything grate about this ACER was not found in my returned to HSN HP laptop.  If you're looking for the best at a great price here it is."
2.0,Would be decent if not for defective hardware,"For a laptop in general, this is a bit thicker (over an inch thick) and heavier than I prefer, but that's the sacrifice you make to have an optical drive, dedicated graphics card, and an SSD for only $600."
2.0,"Para lo que la necesito esta bien, lo malo ...","Para lo que la necesito esta bien, lo malo que  cuando la pague  el 13 de Junio de 2018 a la hora  que me enviaron el recibo me cobraron"
5.0,"Great, great value for a Versatile Business Laptop","I spent 27 years in the computer hardware sales business and am now a 4th grade school teacher. I was recently put in charge of replacing teacher laptops at our school. We needed something with 1080P for our new, HD Smartboards that we will be deploying into our classrooms. We also needed DVDRWs which don't come in all laptops nowadays."
2.0,I want to purchase another one because it seemed like it would be a great machine if it did ...,DOA...  Plugged in the unit and it would not boot up.  No sign of life except for the orange LED showing the unit had power coming in.  Amazon handled the return well.  Had to make a couple of phone calls but all-in-all the response was reasonable and refund received.  I want to purchase another one because it seemed like it would be a great machine if it did power up and it has the configuration/features I like.
1.0,Screen Black On First Boot,"Upon booting up the computer for the first time, the screen remained black. I could hear Cortana and the keys lit up, but the screen remained dark. I called the ACER technical support line, which was useless. After spending 10-15 minutes answering questions (and having to repeat my answers 3x) they pretty much just directed me to hard reset it. When that didn't work, they said my only option was to send my brand new computer in for a repair - which would take who knows how long and cost who knows how much. The tech was EXTREMELY hard to understand and when I asked him to repeat things he would not slow down and seemed as frustrated as I was. This is not the kind of trouble one wants to go through on the first day of having their new computer."
1.0,I paid $600 for a glorified chromebook,"I'm a graduate student so I use my computer for wordprocessing archiving etc. I will say the computer works fantastically for these day to day operations. Obviously if this was all I was trying to do I wouldn't have gotten this computer. I enjoy playing games in my downtime, nothing too taxing, Civ 5, Overwatch, etc. For the first few days the computer worked fantastically and I was thrilled."
4.0,Great Device,"I took one star off because Acer had their hands embedded too deeply in the software...and I had a glitch where I couldn't pin apps to Start...or unpin them. When i got this function to work, then all the icons that I had unpinned returned. Quite annoying...and from what I researched, it might be caused by antivirus software, which the brains on the Internet said to remove. yeah, right. So, I ran my copy of Win 10 Pro over the Home 10 version, effectively resetting my system, but cleaning out bloatware and Acer's dominance. Now the computer runs without gremlins and I love this thing. The keyboard keys have a great feel and the computer as a whole seem solid enough. I've read that some folks are unhappy about the brightness of the screen being too low....but I don't see it. movies and streaming videos are crisp...and the screen is plenty bright. This is a good laptop for the money folks!"
1.0,A total messed up fiasco from the moment this laptop arrived!,"The laptop did not work when received, I flipped it over and simply pushed with my hand and it came up and worked fine."
3.0,overheats easily while gaming,"It's built well, easy to use features, and it holds up well as a moderately priced laptop."
1.0,Replacement Please,"Hi, I got my computer about a week ago but only tried setting it up two days ago, It started up fine and I followed instructions but when I got to the page about setting up wifi the whole computer froze, (the screen was stuck displaying the set up wifi page) I left it alone for about a half hour and it was in the same place nothing worked, I tried ctrl alt delete, turning it on and off with the power button, which did change things it caused the screen to turn competently black when it did to turn on and the key board to light up but that's it, it stayed screen all black key board lit up until I hit power button again so I hit the hard reset button in the back. I got the computer working fine I set everything up linked it to my phone ect, then I had steam messages open, discord open and watching Youtube and the screen again froze completely no audio no nothing just a frozen screen displaying youtube. I tried again and again every trick I knew nothing worked so I hit the hard reset button with a pin in the back of computer, (holding the power button wasn't working). I assume it must be a driver or windows error but since I only go it a week or so again and it was a lot of money I would like a replacement instead of tinkering with it myself to try to get it to work correctly. I kept all the packaging and will be happy to send it back once I get my replacement. thank you"
5.0,Happy customer!,"I'm not a big tech guy, but I more or less know my way around a computer.  I use a laptop for work (I'm a teacher), and for photo editing, music, writing, publishing, web browsing, basic stuff I guess.  I'm not a gamer.  So for my needs, this computer is super fast and easy to use.  It's up and ready to go in 5 or 6 seconds, which is blowing my mind.  It's fast in all other respects as well, except for i-tunes, which I've been reading is really a compatibility issue between i-tunes and Windows 10, not the fault of the computer itself.  I love the light-up keyboard, the size of the screen, and this laptop isn't heavy in my opinion.  It cost more than the entry level laptops but not as much as many others.  I've never used an Acer before so I was skeptical, but that feeling has dissipated."
1.0,Graphics/display problem,"Had it for a couple months, and used it only occasionally.  Eventually the graphics card died or something. No display. Even when connecting to an external monitor, no display.  Had to return. Amazon was good about it."
5.0,Great System for a Great Price!,"This is what I was looking for a in a budget Gaming PC. I am able to play Most AAA titles such as Overwatch, Fortnite, Rainbow Six Siege at Medium to Low Settings at 1080P (Medium to High at 720P). It works well with what I need it for in CAD and other software's that I use for my engineering classes. I would totally recommend this product to any one looking to squeeze the most out of their hardware with this system."
5.0,Had a problem but thankful for a very helpful Acer community.,"I recently bought the  A715-72G-71CT and I enjoyed using it for about 3 weeks. However, just today, while I was doing my work, it froze. After it froze, I tried to shut it down by holding the power button down for a few seconds. When I tried to turn it on again, it would only show a black screen. The Acer logo won't show and Windows won't boot. All this time, the backlit keyboard turns on and it turns off. When it turns on again, it only stays on while my monitor is showing a black screen. I tried connecting it to an external monitor but it's still the same result. Until the issue can be resolved, I'm gonna give this product low marks. However, I'd be willing to take it all back if I could get help with this. I'd hate to see this product get a bad review. But I still have to be honest that my experience with this laptop was disappointing due to what happened."
1.0,Unstable Power Management,"Shortly after getting this laptop, I would have given it 5 stars for its combination of features and value.  Yet six weeks after I got it (two weeks past the date I could have returned it to amazon), it decided it didn't like my  power management settings, which had been working fine, and arbitrarily changed them on its own, which made it unstable."
5.0,Can this game???,"I love this laptop, I got it for gaming and it does that exactly!!!"
3.0,"Computer works fine, however","Computer works fine, however, I was under the impression this laptop came with DDR4 RAM."
5.0,Great computer packing amazing specs for the price. Bang for the buck is off the charts.,"Product was as described. Had it about 3 weeks now. It is very fast and powerful with the new 8th gen i5 chipset and the GEFORCE MX150 is a powerful little GPU. It is of good quality and feels reasonably sturdy. The lid feels a little flimsy which is to be expected at this price point but the keyboard and palm surface feels very solid, appears to be metal.Display is respectable. Brightness doesn't get super bright nor does it go very dim but its good enough. Colors look accurate and contrast and blacks look good. Great viewing angles as its an IPS. Battery life has been great doing normal tasks, roughly 8-9 hours of video streaming at medium brightness and processor set at balanced. Heavy tasks drain it within a few hours, which is typical of any laptop. It does everything blazing fast, never seen it stumble not even once. Glad I purchased it. It is everything I hoped it would be. I would buy it again."
5.0,Just the bee's knees,"This laptop is amazing.  The perfect blend of old (DVD drive) and new (decent mobile GPU, SSD, USB C, and IPS display)."
5.0,nice laptop,"I needed to replace my previous laptop and this one was a close match.  Although it feels less sturdy as my old Toshiba, it has the backlit keyboard and 15.6 inch screen I liked.  The HD screen and fast SSD hard drive is so much better than what I was accustomed.  The sound is OK and I love the long battery life."
5.0,Great value and power for the money,"Great value. Have had no real problems. I also bought an additional 8 Gig of DDR3 memory cheap for it thru an Amazon seller. Adding it was quite easy. There was one slot completely open. I was surprised that the computer uses the HD 620 graphics by default and the Nvidia MX150 for games and certain other programs (like Google Earth which I downloaded) but not an issue. You can change that. The graphics are like glass and the SSD, while SATA, is hugely faster than my old 5400 rpm drive in my old Toshiba. I find the screen is plenty bright myself. In any case, you can bend the screen to about a 30 degree angle with a flat desktop so that it is not in the way when connecting to an HDMI monitor (which can be as bright as you please). The only minor issue I have is that vary rarely the computer may wait to shut down and I need to depress the power key as others have mentioned. But it powers up super well later on. Possibly it is auto downloading some update at the time and not letting you in on it? All in all a great purchase however."
5.0,So far great,"I have to admit that i have had it less than a day, but it is impressive. As for brightness, and I asked the Amazon community about this, thank you by the way, it is bright enough, matte finish screen, and plenty easy to read text. Is it 1500 dollar laptop bright, no. But I am not spending 1500 bucks on ANY laptop, even if money was not an option. People have complained about it being heavy. Give me a break. It is not desktop heavy. It is more than okay for carrying around if necessary. Solid and firm keyboard (nicely lit by the way). Firm hinges. Does not run hot as far as I can tell. Fast startup. Fast browsing. Good wireless connectivity. I know, it has only been one day. But I don't care. So far it is a great laptop with all the connections you will need and the ability to apparently be able to update. For comparison, I recently had an HP that was not much less in price than this one, and it was terrible with regard to the screen and battery life. The salesperson on the phone (can't go to the store to shop), stood right in front of it and told me that it looked great. Yeah, right. Get the Acer. Great unit for just 600 bucks."
4.0,"First Non MacBook laptop, very impressed!","After my $1800 MacBook Pro failed, I as a college student told myself to not spend that much money on a laptop for awhile..."
5.0,Spend the money for SSD storage and more main memory,"Acer Aspire E 15, 15.6"" Full HD, 8th Gen Intel Core i5-8250U, GeForce MX150, 8GB RAM Memory, 256GB SSD, E5-576: The last PC I bought was 2014.  After 5 years I decided to upgrade.  On my old PC I had a 750GB hard drive.  When I checked that old PC I was only using 175GB and 60GB of that was photos. The most helpful review I read before purchasing my new machine was don't do anything but SSD storage.  And they were right.  My old PC was an ACER and I had 0 issues with it over 5 years. It's why in the end I purchased the new ACER machine.  Compared to my old machine the new ACER is a Ferrari.  Very, very quick.  When doing the PC migration, data transfers seemed to be 10 times as fast and when doing downloads on the same internet a similar experience.  For the roughly 75GB of data from my old machine that I wanted available on my new machine I purchased a USB 3.0 memory stick with 128GB for 20 dollars which I leave attached to the new machine. The display is a clear upgrade and I like having the DVD R/W again."
5.0,Perfect for real life,"At first I got an Inspiron 13 7000 with an equivalent to an i7 and 12 GB of RAM. It was a 2 in 1 and it had a touchscreen. That didn't matter to me. It froze 5 times the first day I had it and the battery lasted 3 hours. This laptop I got instead lasts more than 3x that much and it's not a touchscreen. It doesn't bend enough to be a tablet. However, it has modern specs and it lasts enough for me to not bring a charger to school. The keyboard feels great. It can even play some casual games if I need it to. It starts up in 20 seconds thanks to the SSD. It is upgradeable. Best $600 I've spent in a long while."
4.0,Nice All Around Budget Laptop,"Aspire E15 - (E5-576G-5762) - 8th Gen Intel Core i5-8250U - GeForce MX150, 8GB, 256GB SSD"
5.0,easy to use,"The sound card stopped working on the first Acer computer I received.  nothing my computer guy did corrected the absence of sound.  Oh, it worked fine for about 3 weeks and then  the sound would only work if i had ear buds or a headset plugged in.  I called Amazon and they sent out a new computer that day.  Funny thing is as I was transferring files from first computer to the replacement, the sound started working.  But I sent the computer back after getting all my files transferred.  Must be a short in the sound card.  Replacement computer - I love!  Thanks, Amazon"
1.0,Acer support is terrible.,The computer showed up as advertised.  The problem that I have is that it shipped with a BIOS password that has not been provided.
4.0,Back to Windows,After using other OS and being frustrated by some limitations with them I decided to get a Windows system.
1.0,Died in the first day. They don't test their products AT ALL.,"SSD Hard drive failed after 4 hours on the first day. Can't get to the Acer restore because the HD is dead. Can't send it back because it was a gift opened 35 days after purchase. Very pissed. I shopped for weeks and this POS didn't last a single day. Now I have to put up with shipping it for warranty repair. I will never buy another GD Acer. My son's Dell still works fine after 2 years. I could also have opted for an HP. But no, I was sold on the higher specs of this E15."
5.0,So far so great,I have been using it for 2 days now. Too soon to write a review but I plan to post updates to help other customers in making their decisions.
5.0,A very nice laptop for under $600.,"I have been using this model for a year and have been very pleased. This laptop is for my wife.  I will not go over the specifications here as there are lots of Youtube reviews on the E15. I am very happy with the quality of the display, feel of the keyboard and general build quality.  I use this for web surfing, gaming, and general home  management software.  I like that it has a number key pad as many in this price range do not. The key pad is also back lit which is nice. With  no key input back light will stay on for about 30 seconds. With the solid state drive, boot up is about 20 seconds. With an Intel i5 processor, Windws 10 and 8 GB of ram it will handle most general needs. Gaming is mostly things like Counter Strike and Call of Duty. It hadles these with no lag."
5.0,"Inexpensive, GOOD Battery life, dGPU, Expandable Storage+RAM, Best I/O hands down.","If you want good battery life, moderately-priced, dGPU (that you can turn off!), that COMES with an SSD, expandable memory and storage AND has USB-C, a CD/DVD drive, a VGA output, a Kensington lock, 3 USB ports, an ethernet port, a headphone jack, and an HDMI output, then this is the perfect laptop for you!  Oh, and it comes with 802.11 ac wireless, a 1080p display, AND an SD card slot!  Also, you can buy replacement batteries for this laptop very cheaply!"
5.0,Nicely priced laptop,Initial thoughts:
5.0,My thoughts on this product,"Acer Aspire E 15, 15.6"" Full HD, 8th Gen Intel Core i5-8250U, GeForce MX150, 8GB RAM Memory, 256GB SSD, E5-576G-5762"
2.0,One should be bold or greedy enough to take the chances!!!,"This review is after using the laptop for 8 months, and not based on the honey-moon (first impression) review ."
5.0,"Best workstation, casual gaming and photo/video editor value out there atm","Pretty much the best bang for the buck workstation out there.  If you are a bit of a power user but dont want to spend more than 700+ this is the machine right now. 8th gen i5,  SSD, 8gigs of ram and a decent graphics processor this is just tough to beat.  Im a professional writer and the keyboard feels good for a laptop with backlighting being a very nice addition.  My previous machine was also an Acer E15 and i purchased that 6.5 years ago.  Most makers arent producing 5+ year lifespan products anymore.  Hope this performs at least to 5 years as well."
4.0,Awesome performance for the money. Could use better heat management.,"Awesome performance for the price. Can play Planetside 2 on ultra, no shadows. Coming from a laptop with a regular hard drive to one with a SSD is like night and day. LOVE it. Oh yeah, the whole keyboard is back lit. Which is a really cool feature for now...though I wonder what it will look like a few years from now when all the spaces have bits of food and dried soda in them LOL."
1.0,Totally Crashed and Failed After 2 Months,After 2 months this computer has totally crashed. And they will not replace the laptop. Acre says that there is nothing they can do. Online support from India wants to reload the operating system. We have only used this for email and light internet surfing. This is terrible and I would like to return it but the return window closed after 1 month. We bought this due to the good reviews. Please consider this alternate view.
1.0,Stopped Working After 3 Weeks!,"I had to return this Acer as it would not boot up after having it for only 3 weeks. Screen completely black. Also, Windows 10 is a nightmare. Ten companies fighting for your attention when you go online. Windows XP worked perfectly! Will save up and buy a Macbook Air. At least it will turn on. Would never buy an Acer, seemed cheap right out of the box."
5.0,Super quick  and excellent 3D graphics performance for the price - what's not to like?,"I've owned this laptop for a month now.  It's great.  The SSD coupled with the 8th gen I5 processor makes for extremely fast boot times.  Basically, I have enough time to type my password and enter it and the computer has finished booting from a complete shut down."
5.0,Acer Aspire E 15 excellent desktop replacement,"This is a very nice laptop!  Very fast with 2.59 gb SSD hard drive to store programs.  I easily added a WD Blue 3D NAND 1TB PC SSD - SATA III 6 Gb/s 2.5""/7mm Solid State Drive - WDS100T2B0A to store files .  Beautiful high-resolution display.  Both Adobe Photoshop and Corel Painter open fast on this computer.  The 5.27 lb weight is a little too heavy for me to carry around but may be easier for a younger person.  I am not a fan of Win10 but hopefully will adapt to it. This laptop is a good replacement for a desktop.  I bought it when my desktop was in the shop for about a month."
5.0,Does what it's suppose to do with no problems.,"This computer is great! It does everything that I need it to do. I really have not had any problems with it. Not a single one. Okay well, the charger was kind of hard to plug in. It's a very small hole that you have to line up just right. Once you get it once though and you figure out the certain way it goes in you won't have any trouble."
5.0,"Great value, great performance for the price","I purchased this Acer E15 E5-576G after a thorough review of the best available machines at this price point. This laptop checked all the boxes, delivering excellent components in a value-oriented package."
5.0,"Great bang for the buck, but kinda big.","Bought this as an inexpensive multipurpose machine - a swiss army knife of sorts.  I used it for everything - I take to meetings at work, travel for work, run experiments in an engineering lab (hooked up to various other equipment), as well as some light gaming.  Since it gets thrown around a lot in the lab, I wanted this to be a machine that it wouldn't be the end of the world if it were damaged / lost i.e. not a $1000+ fancy unit."
5.0,Highly Recommend.,"This computer does everything I need it to do. Worth every penny. Incredible screen!!! (Clear view from any angle), backlit keyboard (that isn't red), slim and easy to carry around. The SSD card starts this laptop up in >5secs. My need for this laptop is simple web browsing, watching videos/netflix (Easy 1080p), and light gaming. So far it has performed great. No issues. If you are into hardcore gaming or video editting, I would recommend looking for something different. For all other cases, this is the laptop you want to buy."
1.0,How is this allowed,How is it that Acer is allowed to sell faulty products and not provide meaningful support?
3.0,Love/ Hate relationship,"Loved this laptop, Great specs, awesome quality, everything I wanted in a laptop for my work from home business. I got all the updates set up and wanted to set up the NVIDIA graphics card, after being on ACER tech support for over an hour then confirmed I recieved a defective unit. I also noticed the laptop went on sale for $30 less, and Amazon would not honor a price match which I think is just bad business and horrible customer service, all in all I am returning this laptop and went with the ASUS Vivobook F510AU with an upgraded SSD on the way. Very excited to get a new working laptop. I hope to buy one of these in the future because it was a very fast laptop and solid keyboard."
4.0,Great performance for the price.,"I've owned other Acer computers, so I knew going in that this was going to feel very cheap since the whole thing is plastic but I also knew that Acer machines tend to last a long time so long as they aren't dropped.  That cheapness of build is the first negative and the second is the Acer black screen.  Turn the computer on and if you don't immediately get to putting in your password, the screen will go black and the only way to turn in back on is to hold down the power button until the machine resets.  Same if I try to resume from just the screen shut off to save power.  This is the 3rd Acer machine, two Windows, one Chromebook that I've had this issue with.  It's consistent between the 3 so it must be an Acer thing.  Third is the bloatware pre-installed.  Their ""Care Center"" has been utterly useless from the start.  The ""Quick Access""  doesn't do anything that Windows doesn't do natively.  Summary, it's a great machine for the price, but not for those prone to dropping nor letting the screen shutoff and it includes Acers' garbage software.  BTW, my work around for the screen issue is to set the screen timeout for 4 or 5 hours.  That's no good on battery life, but did I mention price?"
4.0,Best bang for your buck,"Best bang for your buck hands down. Yes, it's a little over an inch thick and a tad heavy compared to today's ultra books. Yes, it has thick bezels, a matte screen, and you can't view the screen at any angle (just sit in front of the laptop? Never understood why you need to view the laptop screen from a side angle). However, it's fast, responsive, great backlit keyboard, pretty good track pad, all the ports you'd ever need, easy access to add another stick of ram and another hard drive, long battery life, and a graphics card that will let you do some light gaming while providing good quality. If you love Fortnite this laptop has no problem running it. It has a little bloatware to uninstall but not that much. Go to acer's site and update your bios to the September 2018 update. If you want the best laptop you can buy for $599 this is it. Period."
4.0,Not bad for medium-duty work.,I’ve had this machine for nearly a year now. I’ve tricked it out about as far as it can go - I added memory up to 16gb and added an internal 1TB SSD.
5.0,Great value,"I researched for months to buy this notebook computer for my son to enable him to play some games. Previously I only ever bought cheapest laptops, so this is a quantum leap above what I'm used to. The only hesitation I had was that the screen quality was often criticized in reviews, but hesitate NOT!. The screen is easily the best screen in the house. It has the best contrast and viewing angles. I don't understand why someone wouldn't be happy with it. It makes me wonder if ACER upgraded the screen after some poor reviews. Anyway... battery life is great, my son can play Fortnite on it, the illuminated keyboard is great, the boot time is slick and downloads happen considerably faster than our other computers. The size and weight are quite reasonable for a 15"" notebook that's not an ultra-book. Perhaps I'm easily impressed and I don't know what I'm missing with better quality gaming notebooks because I've never had one. I do think this computer would impress anyone who is stepping up from bargain computers into the gaming class and I'd recommend it for general use as well as gaming because of its screen, sound quality, battery life and fast start time."
5.0,YES!,"I love this thing! It runs so much faster than anything I've ever had. I work online with video calling 8 to 10 hours a day.. I can do the video calls and pull up other online sites and it runs my camera and headphones. Just WOW! Also, my son plays Overwatch. He can now actually play the game. He said it was lighting fast."
5.0,Very happy with this laptop so far,"I did a lot of research on this before finally biting the bullet and taking a chance.  Granted it wasn't much of a chance.  Most of my research was done here in the reviews and most of the reviews were good, with a few that were bad.  I had read about the screen not being bright enough or going out after a short time, about the stroke of the keys not being long enough, about the build quality being subpar or feeling cheap, the trackpad being sticky, and probably a couple other things I'm forgetting...and the only one that I SOMEWHAT agree with is the brightness of the screen.  I usually have it all the way bright and it's about where I'd like it, so it would be nice if it had an option to be a bit brighter, but I usually type on it indoors and at night so it's not a huge deal for me.  I've also gone through the darker settings just to see what it's like and it actually isn't too bad a little dimmer."
2.0,Hinge shattered 4 months after warranty ended.,"I was very happy with this laptop when I got it, to the point where I recommended it to all my friends. The hardware inside is quite powerful and the system is very expandable. However! The build quality definitely leaves something to be desired. After owning it for a little over a year using it for 8 hours or so every day at home, the right side hinge shattered, with multiple metal and plastic pieces breaking at once. The way the top part of the case is put together in general is extremely flimsy. The casing around the screen is clipped together very loosely, and the hinge frame is only attached to the LCD on the top and bottom, unlike my other laptops where is it secured to the panel at multiple points along its length."
5.0,This is the best value or bang for your buck laptop as of ...,"This is the best value or bang for your buck laptop as of right now, in my opinion."
5.0,Well worth the money...,"I've been operating computers for a long time - nearly 25 years, so I'm somewhat dubious as to the bells and whistles that the manufacturers of a computer puts out.  But I was in need of (another) a laptop. My last one was a tablet put out by ASUS and it didn't work very well for me. After much research I bought the Acer Aspire E15 laptop. I was leary because my folks had an old Acer that basically was a POS. I got the laptop and immediately ran into a Microsoft download issue... I almost returned the computer because the download was SO SLOW - it took 5 hours to download the update with a 50kbs per second rate of speed! I questioned the download speed, however, I was going to see it through so I left it on its own to load. Came back when the download was complete and turned it on... I was stunned by the speed of this laptop! Not a super computer, just something I could use when I was traveling. Now I've always been a fan of Firefox and Google. However I decided to stick with the Microsoft Edge for my main home page to see what it could do. Again, I was impressed with Edge and decided to use it consistently. I've got nothing but great things to say about this computer -and would buy it again in a nano-second. Great Speed, great power, great price. The only problem I saw was that you have to download the Microsoft update as soon as you get the computer. It is as slow as anything you ever experienced and you question the speed of the modem. But once your past that issue... the thing just flies!!!"
5.0,Killer laptop! (but know that the screen isn't IPS),"This is an awesome laptop and it has by far the best specs for the money that available right now. I've had it for a month now and have had no problems whatsoever. I'm basically using it as a desktop though because the screen kinda sucks and I rarely have to take it out of my office...but I didn't take off a star because of the screen because I knew this would be a trade off for the killer hardware (you won't find a any new desktop or tower with these specs for 600 bucks either). I did a ton of research and ended up pairing this laptop with the Dell S2715H 27-Inch Screen LED-Lit Monitor and the Anker Ultra Compact Slim Profile Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard with Rechargeable Battery, Universal Compatibility with iPad and Computer - Black. The setup is killer and all came in at under a grand with 4 year insurance."
5.0,Great screen and perfect for playing Sims 4,"This review applies to the version of this laptop that I purchased, which is the Core i5-825OU / MX 150 Graphics / 8 GB Ram Memory / 256 GB SSD / ES-576G-5762 version. I purchased this laptop with the intent of primarily using it to play the PC game, Sims 4. I’ve been using it for a couple of months now, and I have to say, it has outperformed my expectations. It boots up quickly, as does the game, and the game does not lag, even in full mode, while playing it, and I have several packs installed with the main game. The screen is vivid and clear, and the sound is decent as well. For the price, I absolutely cannot complain or say a bad thing about it. Response time is fast, and the build is solid. It looks nice, too. The only thing I don’t care for is the built in mouse pad / mouse, which is a bit hard to use for gaming. I bought an external wireless mouse though, so this solves the issue. I think this laptop is excellent overall and a bargain for the price."
1.0,Make sure your games are compatible with this Nvidia GPU!!,"I've always liked Acer Laptops; this is my third. I bought this especially for gaming. My 7-year old Acer just couldn't keep up with the graphics in the recent expansion of Elder Scrolls online, even though it's still perfectly fine for actual computer work. But playing online computer games is my entertainment, so I invested in a new gaming laptop. I was so excited to see the beautiful graphics in ESO, which only lasted for a few days before the screen started flickering like there was a short. And then the screen would go black, but I could still hear the game sounds, so I knew it must be the screen or the graphics card. I updated the Nvidia drivers; it got worse. I googled the problem and discovered that, while a couple hundred games support Nvidia GPU cards, ESO is not one of them!!! If I had only known. I don't  know if this is Nvidia's fault or the game's fault. I disabled the Nvidia driver and I'm running the game on the Intel GPU, on low quality, with low FPS and jerky movement. I am so disappointed. When you buy a ""gaming"" computer, you sort of expect it to be compatible with popular games. My last Acer was great for a long time. I will have to shell out all the extra money for an external graphics card setup. 😭"
4.0,Awesome Laptop.,This laptop is pretty nice. It has it's ups and downs.
1.0,DON'T BUY ACER!,"I gave this computer a good review when I bought it 1/19 Well, hold everything! Now, 6/19, it crapped out-won't boot up. I have entered the serial numbers on various sites like YouTube, but despite the same numbers, the computers on the repair videos are all different from mine. They all tell me to find a pinhole on the back and blah blah blah. Mine doesn't have a pinhole. Period. I know what a pinhole looks like and I am not blind; my computer does not have a pinhole. I could not convince Bangalore Bill of this over the phone with the repair center. So now, AT MY EXPENSE WITH A COMPUTER UNDER WARRANTY, I have to ship it to Texas for repairs. I don't have any experience with this type of thing--getting warranty repairs on a computer--but this sucks. DO NOT BUY A COMPUTER FROM ACER!! UPDATE: They want $364 to repair a $500 computer that is 5 months old and under warranty. RIPOFF!!"
5.0,Great Buy,"I am no super techie so someone who is expecting more from a laptop might have a different opinion. I use this for school and home use and it is very smooth running, loads quickly and the size has a nice feel. Very easy set up. I had been using it unplugged off and on for 4 days and last night was the first warning I received for low battery, so I thought that was impressive. I had one incident where it would not turn back on, I believe it was operator error, because I just closed it and came back to it the next day and it turned on just fine."
