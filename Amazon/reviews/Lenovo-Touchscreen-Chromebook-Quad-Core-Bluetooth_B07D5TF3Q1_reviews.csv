4.0,A good chromebook for the price,"I wanted to wait a while before reviewing this product as I feel it’s not proper to review within a day of having it. I bought this after my laptop died and I wanted something I’d get quickly and also something cheaper than a laptop. Obviously a chromebook is NOT meant to be a laptop replacement. This does not support gaming like steam or anything hardcore. It doesn’t support the usual apps you’re used to such as iTunes BUT there are ways to get around it if you search up in the chrome store. I’m an online editor and this is still powerful enough to handle that. The touch screen works just fine I love it and the chromebook is very sturdy when flipping the screen I have no worries about it snapping or anything. It’s a good chromebook for the price, you obviously make some sacrifices of what it can handle to a laptop. Microsoft office still works just fine. It can handle the basics and things like Netflix Hulu etc you can have more than one tab open and it not be slow. I think it was a good swap for me compared to purchasing a pricey laptop. Chrome books aren’t for everyone but I do enjoy this one."
5.0,Looks like it does some 4K! Bang for your dollar,"This is my first Chromebook and I love it! Pretty neat you can flip the keyboard behind and turn it into a tablet! Boot up and shut down is super fast. Most apps will work from the Google Playstore.(which comes installed). Updates to the Chromebook itself is done through Chrome Browser.  They're 3 update channels you can choose. Official, Beta and Dev. :-D  I currently have my Chromebook set on Dev update channel and no issues what so ever. Why not try the latest features?!"
5.0,Awesome is an understatement!,"Awesome considering it's chrome, that aside scrolling is very smooth, great pixels in the display. I'm recommending it so much we are purchasing a 2nd unit for my gf. She decided after messing with mine to trade in her laptop (That came a a surprised to me). Oh and I've actually found a Stylist for this chromebook after contacting Lenovo, The Lenovo Active Pen was recommended to me. I hope this helps anyone reading this review and looking for a stylist to go along with new Lenovo."
5.0,Just what I wanted,"It is my wifes and she loves it.  Had a older one, but it could not run all of the android apps like this one.  That makes this so much more usable."
5.0,Good buy!,"My boyfriend’s daughter has one, bought this for my daughter’s birthday, she loves it.  Touch screen make playing games much easier for her and being able to fold the laptop as a tablet is such a huge plus.  Good connectivity hasn’t seen it run too slow or lagging at all.  A good chromebook for sure!"
4.0,Screen size misleading,"I've only had this a few days. I have a ten-year-old Macbook Pro which is getting heavy and clunky, so thought I'd try an inexpensive Chromebook next, as I'm fairly integrated into Google already."
4.0,No more little phone screen!,"Perfect computer/tablet combo if you are looking to transition from constantly watching things such as netflix, twitch, youtube, etc. from your phone, and want to free up concentration power. Super easy if you have a google account (android) and offers all the necessities of a computer. It can sort of ""game."" Can play stardew valley alright and some simple ones. Use this as a work/reference machine, and it's everything you'd want for the price."
4.0,It's asking me to put a headline and I'm going to put all in all for the money it's a good deal,All in all this is a good Chromebook for the price it does almost everything I wanted to besides link up with my Vizio 4K TV it's not supported I guess.?? LG Samsung and all the other main brands are supported with this Chromebook but it won't link with my Vizio TV
5.0,Christmas Gift,This was a Christmas gift for my 13 year-old granddaughter and it is just what she wanted.  She loves it!
1.0,Machine was sold as new but was not,"The original owner had set up this chromebook as administrator with his/her own password.  Unfortunately they did not provide that password so the second owner got a useless piece of beautiful hardware.  After spending too many frustrating days trying to make the thing work, we discovered the problem and sent it back.  Will not reward Amazon by  purchasing a replacement.  Liked the keyboard and screen!"
