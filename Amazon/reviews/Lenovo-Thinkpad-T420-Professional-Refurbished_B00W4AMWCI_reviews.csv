2.0,Refurbished? Maybe Used..,Before I start I wanted to share that I am a Director of Information Technologies and I only purchase Lenovo Think Pads for Windows laptops - so I have a lot of experience with these.
1.0,"A very risky purchase, laptops are not in good shape","Recieved my t420 from klamp electronics fulfilled by Amazon, it didn't take me more than 10 seconds after it booted for me to figure out there were multiple tiny black spots on the screen indicating dead pixels. On top of that, anytime I scrolled down a webpage or had any kind of video playing, a certain section of the screen would continually flicker. Those are major problems for me considering I paid 280 dollars for a ""certified refurbished"" laptop that wasn't supposed to have problems. I also noticed a few days after the price went back up to 320, which is a complete rip off considering I got the same t420 laptop at a local refurbishing company near me for 140 DOLLARS LESS (180$), for a laptop that looks amazing, has no signs of wear and tear and a beautiful screen, unlike the one I received from klamp electronics which was visibly heavily used, had multiple areas showing signs of wear, keys that were bent,  and an extremely defective screen. They offered to replace it after a few days of badgering them, but after I thought about it, I couldn't see why I would take another chance on a company that would send me this laptop in the first place. I ended up going on Craigslist and getting THE SAME LAPTOP, IN WAY  BETTER SHAPE FOR 140$ LESS. I realize some people have received very nice laptops from klamp but do keep in mind, YOU MIGHT NOT GET A GOOD ONE!!! terrible experience, terrible price, terrible product. Please click if you found this helpful"
2.0,Good PC - bad advertising,1st off - I really like these laptops. The machine use itself seems better than expected in performance - just what I expect from Lenovo - thank you!  : )
5.0,Excellent Value,"I am very happy with this laptop that runs great and looks like it is brand new.  I have few ThinkPad's of all sizes and wanted to replace one of my 14"" ThinkPad that had a board issue and another that was running AMD. Anyway this laptop runs great and the Windows 10 icon popped up, so I may or may not upgrade. It has an express card slot and installed a SD card reader in the slot. Battery life seems good with the extended battery."
3.0,although I purchased the laptop for business purposes I'm sure there will be times when I need to view a video and the audio was,"I purchased this laptop for business purposes and it met my expectations; however, sometime roughly a month later the hard drive was not seen by the laptop early in the booting process and I needed to return it for exchange or repair but I was past the return window policy by Amazon. I'm currently attempting to contact the vendor because, according to the details, it is within the 90-day warranty period so I'm hopeful things will flow smoothly in getting the problem resolved. On a lessor note, although I purchased the laptop for business purposes I'm sure there will be times when I need to view a video and the audio was barely audible and low quality (lower than a poor quality cell phone) so you can expect to need external amplified speakers if that is an important factor. It is important to thoroughly test your purchase during the warranty period and I did BUT I was booting from sleep mode and had no way of knowing it might not ""cold boot"". I try to extend the life of my purchases and that is a trade-off in thoroughly testing the product by testing every available function before the warranty expires."
5.0,Best Laptop I've Ever Used.,"I love this laptop because of the traditional keyboard. I have arthritis in my hands and the traditional keyboard is easier to use, also, I like the sound of the keys clicking :-)  I like everything about this laptop. It would be nice if the screen was a little larger but I've gotten use to the 14 inch screen now. I also like that the keyboard is lighted when you tap the Fn and PgUp buttons. This laptop is easy to use and has a clear crisp picture. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
5.0,You can't beat this for the Price. Will outperform Your 2 in 1 any day!!!,"I love it. I was Hesitant to order it knowing I would need windows 8 Pro or above for my job, and that this pc might be considered a bit dated. However it's the best laptop I've had in a while. Nice big heavy Duty Machine. The specs are amazing for this price point. You just can't beat it. Also I got a much smaller SSD instead of the larger HD which to me is actually a bonus."
3.0,"so-so refurbished laptop, no working dvd and bad usb ports","i love the older thinkpads! i got this refurbished t420, and with one major (and one minor) exception, i am very happy with it."
4.0,Great for the price,"Had it a few days now. I got it when priced at $188 in order to teach some kids programming on linux. For those purposes, I expect it will be fine. The machine casing is a bit dated, but you have to expect that for the price, and the casing and screen seem to be in near-new condition. The only thing uncomfortable about the machine is the trackpad -- it's rather small and feels very 2011, so you might well want to invest in an external mouse. I haven't tested the battery out yet -- that to me is of secondary concern. If your goal is to get an inexpensive machine to play around with linux distributions, then this machine is great. You dont want to go less than 8GB RAM, and you won't find much cheaper with these specs. My only qualm (and the reason it's 4/5 and not 5/5 stars) is the misleading/confusing specs. I thought that 512GB SSD (as suggested in the descriptions) for this price was too good to be true, and it is. It's 320GB HDD. Again, that's fine for the price and my purposes, but the seller lets itself down by not coming across as fully transparent."
4.0,Worth it...,"Needed a new machine for the office to replace the old Vista clunker for spreadsheets and word doc proposals. My kids run Thinkpads for school, and I was impressed by the build. My machine was running Windows 10 (not 7) and was upgraded to 8 gigs of RAM as advertised. The hard drive has enough space for work files and the years old processor is plenty snappy for office stuff. There were some scuffs here and there as well as dust in the hinges- however the machine booted up and is running flawlessly.  The T420 is a 2011 produced machine (I think?) so come on guys, at that age there will likely be some superfical scratching here and there. The keyboard feels flawless new and is really ""clicky"", and the screen is fine. It picked up the printer and mouse no sweat, and gets a wi-fi signal at a decent range. at $210, its a great option for productivity- just don't plan on DOOM at 60 fps."
1.0,Broken parts came with this unit and Windows7 activation code was not valid it automatically opened to windows 10 preinstalled,The machine looks not only used but broken: The keyboard and the sides and front and the whole outside has smudges and marks and scratches. The dvdrom falls out if you tilt the laptop on its side you have to push it back in and keep the device flat to keep it in. The monitor plug prongs are missing so the connector doesnt stay and not one of my hdmi plugs fits into the hdmi connector so i have no way to dock this machine. The worst review I want to mention though is that I only bought this so that I could have windows7 but this system's startup rejected the windows7 sticker product ID saying it is invalid so I said i'd activate later but even with Amazon help it would only install windows10. very unhappy with this. i've bought refurbished products before without problems. These are just what i've noticed in the short time i've had it.
4.0,Great value (used) Lenovo Thinkpad.  True to sellers description,"This USED Lenovo Thinkpad is a great computer.  I purchased it for my elderly mother for a couple of reasons: Windows7 is more familiar,  outstanding keyboard, rugged, and reliable.  She only uses it for the Internet.  I've owned 3 of these in the past at my work and they continually prove to be reliable for > 4 years.  The only reason why i didn't give it 5 stars is because the screen had a few small scratches on it that appeared like a couple of dead pixels.  Otherwise, a great used laptop and true to the sellers description.  Seemed to have a fresh Windows7 installation with no unnecessary bloatware!  Only had a licensed version of Windows7 and a few small Lenovo utilities.  Clean setup and simple.  I set it up for her with the basics: Firefox, Skype, CCleaner, Picasa3, and TeamViewer (so I can control it remotely to help her with it).  She's had it for 4 weeks now and is thrilled!  Would purchase again."
3.0,Dead Pixel and Not Windows 7,"Firstly, this doesn't come with Windows 7! Anyways the laptop itself is a good quality it came with the mentioned specs in the description however there is a dead pixel on my screen. I admit I did not notice it the first day however it is there. I will keep the laptop since it is a minor flaw compared to the overall great quality of the hardware itself. Buyers beware this is not a Windows 7 computer; it arrives with Windows 10 pre-installed."
5.0,Nice to have something with a cd drive still,"Bought this rebuilt as an emergency replacement for my T430 which was in the shop. I had a volunteer project deadline and the 7 day  depot turnaround insurance has a glitch-- no part was available for months!!! I think they were planning to have someone swim it over. In the end they offered me a brand new T450s. Used this machine as primary for two months. Use it mostly for watching movies, tv and wanton wandering on the internet. Nice to have something with a cd drive still. Great product for a small cost. If I  need an emergency backup for my main laptop would it hesitate to buy from them"
4.0,Just got my laptop so TBD,I was looking for a good deal and I had one of these Lenovo’s a while back and like it very much.  I just wanted a home PC for basic PC stuff and also some retro gaming.  My plan is to write a follow-up if this thing craps out on me.  So far day one I’ve been very pleased.  It’s actually faster than expected and setup with Windows 10 has been good.  I feel like for what I paid it will be exactly what I need.  My only compliant would be the case of the laptop shows it’s age and has a lot of songs and wear.  I’m ok with that as long as it doesn’t totally blow up on me.  (1/23/18)
5.0,Great laptop,"I received my laptop on time, it was very well pack. I started the computer and it brought me to the set up. It runs extremely fast, I am impressed it looks like a brand new laptop you would never believed it is a refurbished one. I have been using it everyday for work and run movies on it is flawless. I had a previously had a lenovo T420 and was familiar with this laptop including windows 7 pro. I just love it, I only installed Microsoft suites and my own antivirus. It is a great purchase for a great price I am actually writing this review on it :). I will definitely purchased in a future a refurbish laptop from Klamp Electronic"
4.0,Cheap but effective,I got this for playing around with different linux distros as I'll need to become proficient with linux sometime in the near future. I've tried a few on it so far and I haven't had any hardware issues. Everything just works.
3.0,3 out 5,"I received my laptop today and upon opening I was not thrilled. The laptop was in very dirty condition, I cleaned it up and got it running. All the hardware specs were as promised and it shipped with windows 10 (saved me a lot of updating). The N key is blank (not a big deal) minor scuffs. The biggest issue is that the battery does not hold a charge. I called Blair technologies and they informed me that the ONLY thing not covered was the battery but they sent me some links for a replacement. All around I was not completely disappointed with my purchase. I had read some reviews so I was expecting the worst. Overall not terrible but do not expect a pristine factory refurbished machine by any means"
5.0,Excellent,"Product arrived in excellent condition with a few scuffs on the underside. I'm not sure but I believe it even came with the extended battery. I threw in a solid state hard drive and installed Linux Mint and this thing flies. If you end up having WiFi problems then make sure you flip the switch on the right side of the laptop next to the sd card slot, wasted a week trying to figure that one out."
4.0,"Great laptop, crummy vendor","great design, awesome functions, however battery lasted 5 min, after 10hr charge, tried different charger, but still only got 5 min.  Had to buy another battery because the warranty sucks and requires the client to pay and ship bad parts as well as pay for replacement parts which are used and equally unreliable.  Its a great device, but avoid this Seller at all cost, really."
2.0,It's hard to troubleshoot what could go wrong with a product when buying online. I didn't anticipate the problem,.  . Unfortunately there was a problem with the product key that the third party seller could not resolve for me. There was no valid product key to activate and to be in compliance with Windows that was necessary so I had to return it. Also when I bought the product it said it would be Windows 7 and it had Windows 10. When you look at the description there's a space right after which version of Windows it is almost like someone was able to backspace and take the number out so it only said windows and not what version. I wish all third-party sellers would take heed and be upfront and honest consumers are looking for Quality Goods at a fair price.
1.0,Bad experience.,"Lasted less than 2 years. Motherboard couldn't power on. HDD overheated and crashed. Also I ended up paying for recovery of data. Both motherboard and hDD were installed in 2012 atleast 5 years before the purchase date. The average lifetime of motherboard and hDD is 5 years. So, I don't know how the seller certified this refurbished if the parts are already near the end of life at the point of sale."
5.0,A workhorse for any programmer,This laptop is basically everything a web developer needs. The keyboard is excellent and the durability and repairability is unparalleled.
2.0,Good computer but Windows is not activated,"The computer works fine, and Windows 10 Pro is installed. The problem is that the seller either did not activate, or put in an invalid key code. I tried contacting the seller with no response. The computer works fine besides that, but you cannot change some personalizing settings."
5.0,Most cost effective computer I've ever had,"For $295 this is simply a great computer! It works perfectly and came with a good extended range battery. The only thing I don't like about the computer itself is the touchpad. Compared to my MacBook it is primitive and clunky, but that's ok because I have a nice wireless mouse too!  As for the reconditioning, what can I say, it's like new!"
1.0,"The laptop itself was in good condition, no damage that I could see","The laptop itself was in good condition, no damage that I could see. Everything worked correctly..."
5.0,Great laptop is still great,"I had this laptop for personal use a couple of years ago and I picked this refurbished one up for a new staff member. It's just as awesome as it was back then, and the price was perfect. Good refurb work, but it did have some windows 10 junk on it (candy crush, other games). Not sure if that's something the refurbisher could remove in the pre-setup process or not, so I wouldn't hold it against him. Will buy from again."
5.0,Great Laptop!,This is a great rugged laptop. It is used but I can barely tell. The customer service has been awesome and has sent follow up emails to ensure my experience went well. It is rather refreshing as I have had terrible experiences with other refurbished distributors before. Even the paperwork they sent with it was professional with a nice label with the license key. Someone actually put a lot of thought into making this a very smooth buying experience. I own my own computer repair business and they impressed me!
3.0,NIce Computer for the money,Nice computer.  Only issue I have is the case is a little loose on the left hand side.  Not a big deal and not enough issue to send it back.  Just concerned the loose case might get worse as times goes on.
5.0,Awesome Laptop for Awesome Price!!!,"When I fried my last 2 in 1 I needed a reliable laptop that had power and performance. This has it all and I am happy with purchase. I was not very concerned with ""refurbished"" especially after seeing the reviews from the seller and I made the right choice. This laptop looked and runs like new!'n"
4.0,Runs Ubuntu 16.04 with no problems,"I was looking for a fairly basic and dependable laptop that would work easily with Linux and this has fit the bill.  I installed Ubuntu 16.04 and it has worked extremely well.  While the graphics are nothing to brag about, I can play Secondlife, Runescape and other games.  If you want to play high-end games, you'll want something with a dedicated graphics card.  It's not a light machine, but it is robust, sturdy and has sufficient power to do most tasks.  It's a good deal for a second or back-up laptop."
5.0,Exactly what I Need,"I love this thing. I've had it for almost a year now. I got this one because I didn't like Windows 10 at the time. Replaced the HDD with a Samsung 500gb SSD and it performs very well for the work I need done (Engineering Student in College... running simulation programs for homework and such). Probably wouldn't run CAD very well, but I could be mistaken."
1.0,waste of money,This laptop is horrible. It did not come with an AC adapter so I had to buy one (40$). The computer is dirty with food and dust in between the keys. Fingerpad is all scratched up and causes the cursor to go all over the place. Also it  has almost no battery life at a only 45 minutes. This computer also does not charge after it reaches 45 percent. It will be plugged in all day and still will not charged to 100 percent.
1.0,ITS NOT WINDOWS 7 BEWARE!!,"NOT WINDOWS 7!!!! Needed 7 for business machine, not 10 waste of my time. Shame on them for the false advertising."
3.0,Close But No Cigar,Was not real happy because it was advertised as Win 7 Pro and came with Win 10 installed.  This wasn't what I ordered.
5.0,Outstanding buy!,"I was very please with this purchase. It came in virtually new condition. I could find no scratches on it, and everything worked perfectly. My only complaint was that it came with Windows, but after installing a drive caddy, I have it working great with Arch Linux and Freebsd 10.3. I am very pleased with this purchase."
3.0,No Restore Disc,"This is my first Lenovo Thinkpad and I like the machine ok, The refurbished Lenovo did not come with a Restore Disc, so we are up a creek when problems arise.  The reviews are I guess for general type of product regardless of source. The particular product I received did not meet my expectations based on what the listing said at the time."
5.0,Commercial Grade Laptop for a Song,"My first Thinkpad was purchased in 1998 for MBA school and cost a now unbelievable $5K.  I have tried Fujitsu, Sony and Dell and we are back with commercial-grade Thinkpad laptops for good.  This particular Thinkpad was a steal.  It has functioned perfectly and was upgraded to Windows 10 earlier this week.  It also has the older style Thinkpad keyboard, which is a huge plus.  We are very happy with it."
4.0,Very nice system. It is in much better shape than ...,"Very nice system.  It is in much better shape than the T420 that I have been using for work for the past 4 years.  I'll replace the HDD with an SSD that I am not using and with the 8GB RAM in it, it will sing.  Really there are no mars or defects on the surface of the system.  The only weird thing is that the lid is textured with some sort of black sparkly surface.  Not really my taste, but the PC runs great."
5.0,This is a fantastic laptop for the price,"This is a fantastic laptop for the price.  THIS IS A STEAL.  I love the 8 GB of RAM and the i5 processor. Linux runs very well on this machine.  It has a lot of features that don't come standard on more recent laptops, such as a spill resistant keyboard, dedicated volume buttons, and a wifi switch.  Also, it has a matte screen that doesn't glare.  This is a laptop that should last me for several more years.  I couldn't ask for a better laptop for the price."
5.0,But so far - a great value for the money,clean machine delivered quickly. set up was ez... be aware that the refurbishers  have put a sort of resurfacing matt on the front of the machine  - hard to say how long it will last but its well done.  this was a start of the art laptop in its day but you are buying 5 yo technology. I purchased this for travel and its ideal for my needs. If you plan on this being a main machine you might be dissapointed. But so far - a great value for the money.
5.0,Great value!,"Love it so far. Its a little dated I think, but it runs great and looks perfect. Lots of memory, and fast processing. Great value for so much memory. Fast shipping. Only downside is that it only comes with a free trial of Office."
2.0,Trackpad and Keyboard not working straight out of the box!!!,"So, just got my Lenovo T420 today. First thing I booted it up and it looked great. Went to go move the mouse and the track pad doesn't work. Okay let me plug in a mouse. Cool now I can move my mouse around and click next for Windows setup. Then I got to the product key started typing and noticed the X key wasn't working. Not just the X key it's the 2WSX keys. Some one must have loved those 4 keys before I got it. Okay so my track pad doesn't work and my keyboard is not fully functional. Called left a message and e-mailed. Come tomorrow if the service department takes care of this issue then I'll change my rating, but for now their lucky to get 2 stars and not 1."
5.0,The Lenova/IBM laptops have always been the best. They are worth the extra cost because of ...,I worked in IT for many years. I've had many laptops. The Lenova/IBM laptops have always been the best. They are worth the extra cost because of the quaulity.
1.0,Bait and switch,"Bought this laptop which was advertised as running Windows 7, received the same model running Windows 10, which is sold here for a lower price. Complete BS, will be returning ASAP."
5.0,"Nice computer, looked like new","Nice computer, looked like new. I found it odd it was running Windows 7 ratehr than 10, and it was too late for the free upgrade. But I was turning it into a Ubuntu computer, so it didn't matter to me. Running Ubuntu this thing is a soilid and relativloy fast unit."
3.0,but despite how good the features sounded,"I'm returning this because after a couple days it started crashing all the time. It hasn't crashed as much after fiddling around with it, but it still crashes every once in a while and the internet stops working a lot. I was looking for the cheapest possible computer with enough memory to use photoshop without too many problems, but despite how good the features sounded, it didn't work like I thought it would."
4.0,Good Value.,"It definitely could have been cleaned Better, but no visible damage or scratches. I really wanted a Win7 system, but it was Win10. Not a big deal as everything appears to be working correctly."
1.0,amz customer service was excellent.,"The first one I ordered did not boot.  The second one I ordered did not run without being plugged in.  I don't see how these could have been ""certified refurbished"".  I returned both; amz customer service was excellent."
5.0,Laptop has worked exactly like a new edition,"This rehabilitated laptop was ordered to replace an identical model that had died. It shipped promptly, the packaging was adequate (everything was intact on arrival), and the Windows 7 Office product key was in place. Laptop has worked exactly like a new edition."
5.0,It's a tank.,"Bought this because I wanted something durable and reliable, and have not been disappointed. Battery life is also a great surprise, almost twice as long as my old Acer."

1.0,Value ThinkPad? Think Twice!,"This computer runs extremely slow and has had issues from the day I got it. In fact I just spent nearly as much as it cost to get windows totally reloaded by Best Buy Geek Squad. So disappointing, definitely feel like I was taken advsntage of"
1.0,"Disaster,bad state,broken,no battery,dirty, damaged, speakers do not work.A fraud. Dont buy","Disaster,bad state,broken,no battery,dirty, damaged, speakers do not work.A fraud.Do not buy anything."
5.0,Perfect,"I couldn't be happier. Computer runs unbelievably fast, has good battery life, and arrived in perfect physical condition, with the exception of a couple light scuffs on the bottom. It would be impossible to find a new system as good as this at such a low price point."
5.0,Shut off updates unless you want Windows 10,Works well.  Good customer service.  Make sure you shut off auto update or you will wake up and find you have windows 10.
3.0,Battery is no good but for the most part a good purchase.,There was a absolutely no battery life.  Maybe 10 minutes at best.  Expected better.  Satisfied with the laptop but not having battery life kinda negates the whole reason I purchased the laptop.  I needed something I could take with me without having to have a power source.
5.0,Works flawlessly. there really is a difference between Lenovo ...,"Works flawlessly.  there really is a difference between Lenovo and Acer.  I know it is refurbished, but I cannot see any evidence of that​."
5.0,The unit is great so far,"The unit is great so far, still getting used to it. realy appreiated the shipping via DHL very fast. You will se us again  as a computer only lasts less than a year due to high humidity and salt in the air."
4.0,I miss my HP and this may help me. ...,I miss my HP and this may help
4.0,Good job Amazon,"Computer battery is at 98% battery out of box, plugged it into power and it tells me 'plugged in, not charging.' Not sure if it's not charging because it's near full capacity but will check on it later when it gets low battery."
5.0,Great refurbished model,"The Thinkpad works great.  I bought refurbished, and it is in almost-new condition.  Very good battery life, almost perfect cosmetically.  This is a real steal for anyone who wants a solid, durable laptop that is going to last."
4.0,Works fine.,"Works fine, looks good.  It came iwth the wrong charger, so I had to take the time to get a new one - Amazon provided it."
4.0,Just the right size !!,"This is "" just my size"". I seem to have big, ugly fingers and the keypad on this unit fits my hands well. Some are so small I cannot handle them. It's also a great size unit to carry when traveling. Of course it's Windows 7.. hooray..  Thanks."
5.0,Great Laptop and Great Order Experience,This laptop is outstanding.  My company needed several and so we bought four of them.  They are all just what we needed and more than we expected.  No reservations at all about this model of laptop or the seller that Amazon used to fulfill the order.
4.0,Works as expected,"Does what I need it to do. Will play simple games without a problem, good for working on the go or watching videos in bed. I have only two problems;"
1.0,would love to be contacted to discuss my options,"Looking to get in touch with seller - this laptop has crashed multiple times - we are always getting the bluescreen - it has been almost daily. this is not even a year old at this point - very, disappointing purchase - not operating smoothly at all. would love to be contacted to discuss my options."
5.0,Superb quality for a superb price!,Great computer. I got the 8GB RAM version. Super fast! Easy setup and not a bunch of extra applications to slow start-up. Can’t go wrong with these Lenovo Thinkpads. Industry standard!
5.0,Was as expected - No surprises,I received the t420 laptop and could not find the Windows product license key sticker on the bottom side. I emailed refurbsupport@metropc.com and got a very fast response that the sticker is under the battery.
5.0,Great Laptop! Not a gamer by any means but ...,Great Laptop! Not a gamer by any means but as a Network Engineer this is a fantastic unit at a wonderful price.
5.0,A great laptop. Totally met my expectations,A great laptop. Totally met my expectations. If the web cam had more pixels then it would have been perfect. Still deserves a 5 star though.
4.0,Bad Battery,"Not sure what to do as the Battery keeps saying Battery not installed.  IT guy my daughter took it to, says its a bad battery.  Other then that it seems to work ok.  I am editing this because they have fixed the problem and are sending me a new battery.  With that fast response and fix I would definitely recommend."
1.0,BUYER BEWARE!!! Unlicensed/illegal version of Windows,"Microsoft will not validate or update this copy of Windows, saying it appears to be invalid/counterfeit, which means many things simply won't work.  Speaking of which, I bought this exclusively to use to work from home (remote desktop), and that is not an option as Citrix can't be installed with the bogus version of Windows, so this machine is essentially a $300 decoration now (until I shell out for another copy of Windows 7 Pro).  Very disappointed in the seller selling illegal software given their high rating and partnership with Amazon's ""Certified Refurbished"" program (which is sort of an implied endorsement by Amazon)."
5.0,Outstanding Refurb'd Laptop,"Having been in the corporate IT world for the past 20 years, I know my computers.  All of my PCs over the past 20 years have been IBM/Lenovo Thinkpads, so I am familiar with the series and capabilities.  I ordered the T420 as it's a corporate series instead of a consumer series (better build and specs).  I was leery of a refurb but based upon other reviews I thought I would give it a chance.  When I received the laptop, I was beyond impressed - the laptop was immaculate.  I mean not a scratch on anywhere on the case, no keyboard wear, no mouse wear.....nothing.  I'm convinced that the seller must have refurb'd/replaced all of the above.  My corporate issued T450 already has keyboard & mouse wear  after 9 months - so whomever refurb'd this laptop did an outstanding job.  I would definitely buy again from this vendor."
5.0,Five Stars,gift for my daughter-in -law  Wish I had kept it and given her my dell notebook
5.0,Just what I wanted,"""Like new"" computer exactly as  described.  Relatively quick processor and ram, adequate hard drive, up to date operating system (64 bit). I am quite pleased with it. Thanks"
5.0,"Excellent laptop, excellent service!","After I received my thinkpad (right before hurricane Irma struck Miami, two days before expected delivery) I noticed that it was missing the trackpoint nub. I contacted microbee, and they sent one to me free of charge. The laptop itself arrived clean, with no physical imperfections and a perfect screen."
3.0,"Beware, listed as Win 7 in comparison but is Win 10!","Beware, comparison chart lists this as with Windows 7, but in the main listing in fine print it indicates Windows 10. The laptop itself is good and in good condition, but useless if you need Win 7."

Almost immediately it started having issues and at now I only get a black screen after I've logged in. My disappointment is compounded by the fact that I purchased this computer just a few months ago.

4.0,good start up speed,"Functions well, good start up speed. Would have gave it five, but the battery does not hold a charge for long. It dies after 1/2 hour. Overall, a good buy!"
4.0,Love,4/5 because the battery was awful. Purchased a newer and larger battery and the laptop is an engineering school beast. Love it
5.0,Love it! Works great and it's durable,I'm writing this review on my Lenovo! Love it! Works great and it's durable. Only thing is it's a bit bulky but I got past that really quick
5.0,Five Stars,None
5.0,I am going to purchase another T420 from Park Deals,"Great laptop.I satisfied totally,thank you.Looks like new.Work fast,no any issues."
5.0,Great machine,"On/off button is a little worn, does not have positive action, but works fine (so far).  This is a refurbished item - software is working fine.  This is my second Lenovo Thinkpad, and I have had so few problems with it, I'm afraid to write about it and jinx myself.  :)"
5.0,Five Stars,"Very nice laptop, well maintained."
2.0,used one,I bought this while it was a used one. return it successfully.
1.0,Sent it back.,Very unhappy with it.  It had a constant flickering in the screen.  And it seemed to have a mind of its own... Resetting / rebooting itself while I was working on it.  Very unreliable.  I even had a technician check it out.  He recommended that I send it back.  Returned it after 10 days.  Disappointed.  I won't buy a refurbished computer again.  Learned my lesson the hard way...you get what you pay for.
5.0,Great computer,"Computer came well packaged, on time and in perfect condition.  Came with start up instructions and the charger for the computer. Advertised on Amazon as having windows 7 which I was looking for to play older games, but it actually comes with windows 10.  Fortunately I am still able to do what I want with the computer so not a problem!"
2.0,I love the brand and laptop,"I love the brand and laptop. After a couple of days, the battery became defective. I contacted the seller. After a few days, I didn't receive a response so I refund it."
5.0,Five Stars,Loved this baby til the day I broke the screen!
5.0,Great for the Money!,Great computer for my needs.  Nothing fancy but very functional!
5.0,"product as advertised, delivered on time","The unit arrived looking brand new, and got up and running quickly with no glitches. Excellent buy!"
5.0,Great Value - Looks Like New!,Great value for the money.  Perfect for everyday use.  Made well (already dropped it 2x and runs like a charm!).  Hard to believe it's a refurbish - looks like new.
4.0,The device arrived in great condition. Another review had shown some fairly bad ...,"The device arrived in great condition. Another review had shown some fairly bad damage to their machine so I was a little worried, but I see no damage to my device. After about 2 days of heavy use (I have used older models of the thinkpad or else I wouldn't write the review so early) I can say this is an extremely solid machine. The Windows 7 is nice, especially if you are wanting to get these for the workplace. Albeit, I did replace the OS with Kali Linux (which runs incredibly fast even on the slow HDD)."
2.0,"Otherwise laptop was in good condition, minimal scratches and wear","Laptop listed with ""320 GB flash_memory_solid_state."" Came with 320 GB hard drive instead. Otherwise laptop was in good condition, minimal scratches and wear."

3.0,service is great and the laptop condition is excelent,"The laptop its ok. The model is diferent thogh, i've got a Lenovo Thinkpad T430 instead of a T420 with at least minus 25GB hard drive and no bluetooth. Despite, service is great and the laptop condition is excelent."
3.0,Shot battery,Looks like it's in good condition. Pretty irritated that the battery is shot though and I can't be on it without it plugged in.
5.0,it is a perfect laptop for the price,"I have only had it for a few days, however, it is a perfect laptop for the price. The only issue I have is the slow start up, but that can be fixed with an SSD. Thus far, great product for a great price."
1.0,Refurbished computer had dirty keyboard ( hairs and dust visible in keyboard) noisy ...,"Refurbished computer had dirty keyboard ( hairs and dust visible in keyboard) noisy fan on start up, worn out touch pad, and arrived locked. Packaging was not secure either"
5.0,Excellent condition. Value for money,This is my second purchased for the same model. Excellent condition. Value for money.

5.0,Five Stars,Works fine.
1.0,"The battery wouldn't hold a charge, it hung up ...","The battery wouldn't hold a charge, it hung up on the Windows update screen so I couldn't get it current and because of that I couldn't get my company's VPN client to download. You get what you pay for I guess. It's being returned, life is too short."
1.0,FRUSTRATED!!!,I turned it on did some initial set up and now it won’t turn on! UGH!

5.0,Five Stars,"Great product, fantastic value. I would buy from them again"
4.0,I like it very much,"It's not as fast as I thought it would be, but other than that, I like it very much."
5.0,Honestly Suprised,"I did not expect to receive the quality of product I was sent for such a low price! The product description is spot on, it comes with Windows 7 Pro SP1, 8GB DDR3 RAM, and a lightning fast Intel Core i5 clocked at 2.5ghz. This isn't something that you should expect in a laptop that ships for a little over $300! The overall product build is sturdy, very few visible light scratches on the case, and all the pixels on the display seem to be in working order. I don't often review products, but considering this was my first go at a refurbished laptop I couldn't be more happy! I highly recommend the Thinkpad T420 from Park Deals."
5.0,Laptop,It's an amazing device. I was really surprised at how well it works. Definitely going to get another one in the future.
2.0,Two Stars,This product is not working it has three keys that do not work and fan is very very loud.

5.0,Five Stars,great price for a great laptop
3.0,Annoying.,The keyboard is very uncomfortable; had to install a special utility to stop the cursor from jumping all over the place. Windows 7 doesn't have an option to disable the touchpad.
5.0,Five Stars,These refurbs look brand new and were delivered promptly.  Thank you.
5.0,"Great, cheap product",Really fast computer for the price.  I've had it now for three weeks and it works perfectly.

5.0,Great Gift,Was a gift to the church.  They are well pleased with machine.
4.0,Great way to afford a good computer.,"Great deal, but I had to pay to get rid of a nasty virus that could have been attached to my stuff."
1.0,Screen came cracked!,I need to pay $150 to replace the screen before ever using it.
5.0,T420: Great Refurbished Product!,"This laptop functions well and faster than I would have expected! With it functioning so reliably in areas such as programming, basic school work, and other job related areas, I'm surprised the t420 did not cost higher!"
3.0,Battery NOT good!,fine...EXCEPT battery does NOT hold charge!
5.0,Exactly what was described.,"Clean, Crispy and ready to go."
2.0,LT with keys that can't be read!,Multiple keys on the laptop that I purchased can't be read and Amazon refuses to ship new keys.
3.0,Updates do not work,This is a 2nd shipment received. Units seems to be in decent condition but Windows Update does not work. I have tried to call support to fix this but only Vmail.  This is truly a problem because without the updates your system is not secure. I would think this authorized refurbished unit would be 100% compliant with Window Update Service.
