5.0,Excellent all around.,I rarely post reviews but I think this shop has a repeat customer in me. Hopefully helpful in it's length :)
4.0,Its seriously hit or miss. I ordered two of ...,"Its seriously hit or miss. I ordered two of these. One came windows 10 one came windows 7. The windows 10 came from amazon texas distribution and windows 7 from NJ distribution. I know because i ordered on same day and they came two different carriers. The windows 10 is going back, ordered another to play roulette again."
1.0,Not real happy with the vendor,"Laptop came with a dent in the outside top cover and two dents inside where the latches for the cover engage the lower half near the keyboard. Bottom cover latches near the docking port on the underside were unlatched and only one would engage and lock. When plugged in battery started charging, but Windows said no functioning battery was found so I suspect battery was defective. Biggest problem was Windows 7 wasn't activated and there was no activation code included. Windows also said the copy of Windows installed wasn't genuine. I ran a code retrieval program that got the activation code from the registry and when I tried to activate Windows it said the activation code was a generic one and couldn't be used. Got a return label from Amazon and will send it back tomorrow, reordered another from vendor Blazing Prices and hope to get a functional computer with the second attempt. Not real happy with the vendor, leaving in a couple of days on a business trip and need this computer for work-related tasks. With the delay I'll be hard pressed to get all  my software installed and functioning before I leave. Kudos to Amazon customer support tho for quick response tho,"
1.0,Simply never buy a Certified Refurb from this vendor. Please read details,Product came to me at the office in poor condition without the proper power supply. It is HP with a Lenovo power supply which didn't even fit the power connector on the laptop.  There was sticker residue all over the lid of the laptop from an asset tag I assume.
5.0,Works great. BTW,"The laptop arrived the very next day after ordering.  A little rough in appearance.  No matter as I didn't buy it for its looks.  This unit was over $1500 new, I paid $200.  A new copy of Win-7 is over $100.  I ordered this one as it has Windows 7.  The laptop is rugged and has an added feature, biometric security.  You just run you finger over the fingerprint reader and it fills in the stored password.  I use this to interface the computers in all of my Lincolns.  Works great.  BTW, the one I received is a little bit better than the original product description.  The one I received is a HP 8470P."
1.0,I would not recommend.,They sent me three computers.  The first was defective and the other two came without plugs.  I was going to return my third computer but they never returned my call.  Now I am stuck with it.  I would not recommend.
1.0,Wrong operating system installed,The computer arrived with Windows 10 rather than Windows 7.  I despise Windows 10 and ordered a refurbished computer rather than a new one specifically to avoid it.
3.0,The computer itself works fine and has the speed I need,The computer itself works fine and has the speed I need. But the battery doesn't last long. I will need to purchase a new battery.
4.0,It's a really good deal for the money,"It's a really good deal for the money. It's very responsive and runs quickly. The fan spins up load and starts generating alot of heat if many functions are loaded. This computer works well for low spec gaming and any other minor services you may need for a laptop. I play games like Mass Effect 2, Rimworld, TF2, Shogun 2, and Brawlhalla on here no problem."
5.0,You can't go wrong with this one.,Received well packaged computer that looks brand new. Setup was easy using the enclosed 'comic book' instruction sheet. I was surprised when I found the HDD to be 450GB. Everything worked well except for 2 of the USB ports. I contracted the seller and was told to contact the refurbisher HP. After trying HP internet support maze I found the computer did not have a serial number on record with HP. I again contacted the seller and was told that a return would be OK. I did some searches using Google and found a solution. So now all the USB ports are functioning.
1.0,Monitor Screen Issues,"I was excited to open my ""new"" refurbished laptop.  Nice packaging and the laptop was in excellent condition - no visible scratches.  Unfortunately after getting the laptop all set up, within just a few hours of using the laptop, the monitor screen was having issues.  The picture would glitch, pieces of it were missing and/or distorted, and then it would come back to normal.  In addition, I order the Windows 7 Pro and received Windows 10.  I am very disappointed as this laptop had so much potential."
3.0,Dead Pixel - different version of windows than advertised - decent for the price other than that,Seems to work ok (though havent tested battery yet) - but came with a dead pixel in the screen and what was advertised as Windows 7 Pro is actually Windows 10 Home - I would rather have Win 7 Pro for I could then upgrade to Win 10 Pro without an upgrade. I can return it for the deal pixel but will likely be out another $50-$75 since it took awhile for seller to respond and all the other laptops from other sellers that I was look at are gone at this price point.
1.0,A nice little laptop,"A nice little laptop, but it is not what I wanted.  I wanted a windows 7 laptop with windows 7 as the operating system. Can you send me a Windows 7 disk so I can install that operating system?  If not, how do I return it?"
4.0,Pretty good for the price,"They sent me a paper with it that had the wrong product number, I spent 2 hours till I finally took the battery off and found the write one the 12890 and j keys don’t work but I have a Bluetooth keyboard so that’s not a big deal for me overall it was a great buy so far"
1.0,Don’t do it,"Product came with cords that did not fit product and loose hardware. Too much money for such inferiority when I could spend less than 50 extra and get brand new and better. I didn’t want to leave any review but having received emails DAILY for a review of their garbage, I figured the only way to stop these requests was to offer the truth!"
1.0,NOT A WINDOWS 7 PRO SYSTEM,This laptop was not as advertised. This laptop was NOT A WINDOWS 7 PRO system it was a WINDOWS 10. I was specifically in NEED of a Windows 7 pro system.
1.0,"Misleading description - Windows 10, NOT Win7","Physical condition is great; however, I specifically ordered a Windows 7 - this was 10.  Does no one at Seller side read their own description and the product they're supposed to be selling/delivering?  Besides misleading description, highly annoyed at having to make a trip to courier to return this."
1.0,This is not a windows 7 pro. I bought ...,This is not a windows 7 pro.  I bought it to work with a medical equipment that requires windows 7 ; now have to drive to a UPS to return it. THis is a windows 10 home edition.
1.0,"This is NOT windows 7, it is windows 10 ...","This is NOT windows 7, it is windows 10.  The purchase of windows 7 OEM should be included in this deal.  The description of this computer is incorrect."
3.0,"2nd laptop worked great, even though it was also ordered with windows ...","First laptop had a non functional battery and had windows 10 installed even though the laptop was ordered with windows 7.  2nd laptop worked great, even though it was also ordered with windows 7."
2.0,I ordered this specifically because it was supposed to have ...,I ordered this specifically because it was supposed to have Windows 7 Pro. It came with Windows 10. The label on the machine said Windows 10. The battery is tired and the machine is slow. I'm returning this and now I have to wait another x amount of days for another machine.
5.0,Even though it's refurbished it's a very nice machine and we aren't having any issues so far,I purchased this laptop for my son. He spends most of the day and night on his computer. It's fast enough for his games and has enough storage for his artwork. Even though it's refurbished it's a very nice machine and we aren't having any issues so far.
1.0,"not W7 which would normally be a good upgrade, but I specifically needed W7 to run ...","This came with W10, not W7 which would normally be a good upgrade, but I specifically needed W7 to run windows mobile device center. It also still had a user account on it with a password, so I'm guessing it has not been refurbished and I would have had to reformat just to get started to get around the password"
5.0,Nice laptop at good price,"I received it very quickly after ordering, it was packaged very well and completely undamaged. The laptop runs smoothly and setup was super easy. I'm very happy with my purchase."

4.0,I ordered 10 of these and overall they are great laptops. I had a couple minor issues,"I ordered 10 of these and overall they are great laptops. I had a couple minor issues, but they sent me the parts I needed right away. The only thing I would say was a little misleading is that the photo shows the version with a fingerprint scanner. Out of all 10, only 3 of them had that feature."
5.0,A reliable product and company,Great product! Great deal!
4.0,"Great product, why buy new when you can quality refurbished at a fraction of the price.",We have had this laptop for just about a month now. So far we have been very satisfied with our purchase. The laptop came completely cleaned of programs and proper start up instructions. The only reason for not the 5 star rating is on occasion the screen flicker for a few seconds. I have been researching what could be causing this issue but it is minimum so for our use it doesn't bother much. We use this laptop for our middle school aged child to do their homework and we also have a large music mixer program installed. Plenty of room on this unit.
5.0,Five Stars,Excellent value for the price!! Laptop working very well. Condition is excellent!! Highly recommended.

4.0,Four Stars,Laptop started out great but now the screen glitches no other problems
1.0,Came with incorrect software and hardware.,"I have ordered the hp with windows 7. The description clearly said windows 7. Then I got the computer with windows XP. I was ok with it if the computer worked properly. The computer printer software download keeps failing. I kept downloading zebra 500 printer software but the download will not take place. HP 1020 printer should be plug and play. Unfortunately, the computer did not work as plug and play. I had to manually download the printer software. I was ok with it. Then after the printer driver, I had to manually feed each page of paper to print otherwise printer would not work. you might say there was printer error. But I am not using the same printer with my different HP Computer and it is working."

5.0,great laptop,this is by far my favorite laptop ever purchased. its very reliable for its price. the only  thing i dont like is its got a really loud fan. and the vents tend to get really hot.  do not leave this device on the charger
4.0,Great Once I Was Able To Set It Up,Once I got it set up the computer seems to be doing great.  I did have an issue to start with because I didn't receive an activation code for the Windows software.  There was a sheet telling me about it and where to find it except they told me where to find it for a Desktop computer.  The Key was not on any box or the computer.  I ultimately found a way around it; I just did a system restore that reloaded the windows program and I didn't get asked for  an activation code when I was done.  Thank goodness.  Once that problem was solved the computer became a great deal.
5.0,"Great value, great computer","Excellent.  I did initially have a slight issue with screen flicker, but simply reset the screen refresh rate to 40 megahertz and haven't had a problem since.  Great value, and powerful enough for my needs.  Plus, it's pretty cool looking -- and it looks brand new. Couldn't be happier."
