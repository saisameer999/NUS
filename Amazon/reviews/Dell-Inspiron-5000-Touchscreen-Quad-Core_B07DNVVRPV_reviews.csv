1.0,"Wrong color, Charger didn't work, laptop didn't work.",So I'm not usually one to speak negatively.. or positively. Or really at all about a product I buy. But this is going to be an exception due to the issue noted in the headline.
4.0,Worth the $$$ for a new laptop. Great value for the price,"Worth the buy for a new laptop. laptop comes with built in dvd tray and 12 gb of RAM which is perfect and for the right price (better than buying at Dell website)! windows 10 needs at least 4 GB of RAM to operate otherwise it will be VERY slow. So, 12 GB of RAM allows room for growth over the years and matches the OS. Only thing to improve was the app store program which was finicky and does not install the apps. In addition, I wish the battery was more accessible if you had to replace it after 3-4 years, and had a VGA slot for those who still have an old monitor."
4.0,Good thing I didn't scrimp on RAM,"I don't get it.  The bigger the computer, the bigger the hard drive, the more the RAM, the more stuff they find to cram in.  Don't get me wrong - Amazon's great, Dell's great, this computer is great, but it took me 3 days to update it to today's version and delete all the crapware (Candy Crush, et al)."
3.0,Needs LOTS of updates.  We'll see how it works in the long term.,"Received yesterday.  Since 6pm we have been installing Windows updates.  The machine is installing YET ANOTHER major update this morning.  Every time it finishes, we get the message, ""you're all set"", and then when we check 10-15 minutes later, yet another update is ready."
5.0,Great laptop for the price,Love this laptop. Had Dell before and this is faster and better than the last one. Lighted keyboard is a plus on this model
5.0,PERFECT,Greatest purchase ever! Super fast computer and perfect for college work! Definitely worth the money!
5.0,Great Product,"Good Item, its my 3rd Dell and I enjoy it, the only maybe complain is that is a little heavy, but its ok considering the quality of the product."
1.0,Hard drive broke with in a month,My hard drive went down after a month.  Called Dell - they said it was not the Hard Drive it was software wanted another $140 - $170.00 for a warrenty on software would not fix it without.  I said it was not the software that the computer kept trying to fix itself it said it could not find the hard drive.  Dell refused to do anything else.  Called Dealer they told me to send it to Dell but don't say it the software just tell them to replace it.  Finally called Amazon they said I was past the 30 days (by 1 or 2 days) and could not return it.  They did refund me 10% I intend to get more because I ended up taking the computer to the Geek Squad at Best Buy paid them for a $200.00 all inclusive warranty they did say it was the hard drive and are fixing the computer for me.  needless to say the next purchases I made where at Best Buy for a few other electronics purchased I needed to make.  Dell has lost a costumer and Amazon electronics are not my go to place anymore.
5.0,Great laptop,I like everything about this laptop. I did not rate the sound quality only because I don’t usually have the sound turned on.
5.0,Out-of-the-box ready,"Seems PC's are getting a lot like vehicles anymore.  You're given a base price, but in order just to have a reasonably performent model, you have to double its price with options.  If you're looking for gaming or a true business machine capable of lightning speed and/or able to display more apps than most humans can keep track of, this probably isn't for you.  But if you're simply looking for a truly base-lined model for home or a home business, this PC comes configured for just what you need without spending hours weighing options and sorting through reviews."
1.0,Lame!,Out of the box it took two days to update it. Defragmenter in five times already. Also do not let Fox Professionals install anything for you it is a scam pop up. I don’t even know if the laptop is safe to use now.
3.0,Have had for three days,"Battery live is way shorter than advertised. It's more like three hours, if that. And it is slow. Screen quality is good. Heavy and cumbersome. I think I got spoiled with a really good chromebook that is light and has eight hour battery life, even after four and a half years. The ""mouse plate"" is loose and makes noise and speakers are mediocre. I guess if it does the job I bought it for, it will be ok."
1.0,Very slow!,Computer is VERY slow from the 1st day i got it. Doing simple tasks takes a long time. Just starting it up takes about 5 minutes. I feel like my computer 15 years ago was faster than this thing. Very disappointed.
3.0,'Beware the Bloatware' ... Good laptop -- after Win 10 re-fresh and a 'de-crap',"The seller did everything very well (5 out of 5 stars). Amazon was prompt in delivering this computer (5 out of 5 stars). But ""Bloatware"" loaded by Dell was a pain (1 out of 5 stars)"
5.0,Five Stars,needed the lighted keyboard
5.0,Good bang for the buck!,Nice laptop for the price.  Very fast processor and good features.  Highly recommend!
5.0,I like it,"I've used my new computer for about four months and have not had any major problems.  Good quality for the price especially since I use it mainly for business, accounting, word processing and low speed recreation like streaming movies, music, and photos."
1.0,BATTERY SUCKS,"The product itself wasn’t too bad, the screen is nice and everything. It’s a little slow but it runs videos well. The only problem is the battery. It’s like 2 hours if you have more then one program open, which is ridiculous. Not worth 600 bucks."
4.0,"Good machine, too much bloatware.","The machine is performing as expected so far.  However, there is too much bloatware which takes time to remove.  Especially annoying is a program called SmartByte which, as I understand, is to throttle internet speeds.  I would like to know if this is accurate and if so why Dell would include such a program.  In task manager it's found under services and can be stopped.  Curious."

1.0,wouldn't boot up,Wouldn't boot after charging.  Amazon tech support was great - instant reach out to my issue.  We decided it needed to be returned and waiting for a refund
3.0,Works well good value.,"Works well although it appears to be slower then the Dell Inspiron 3520 that I replaced.  I bought this because I needed a back lite key board.  And it works well.  I have 12 GB of ram, and 1 TB of storage space.  It has everything I need."
4.0,Good quality,Works well I use it for automotive diagnostics I will update if things change
4.0,Great for the money,Great for money one of the best computers I have ever purchased
5.0,Best price,"Definitely happy, the money invested was worth it. Best price for the characteristics that it has. The bad thing is that it heats a little and weighs a little more than normal but considering the cost, it has been a great purchase."
5.0,Computer,Really nice computer really like it a lot! Sound not as good as wanted but you can buy speakers but still good value for the money!
5.0,"Fast, large memory and comfortable to use.","Fast, large memory and comfortable to use. Perfect for its price!"

1.0,Don’t buy!,This laptop sucks. Very slow. Bought it 2 months ago and got black screen of death for an hour tonight. Tried to return but Amazon won’t let me.
5.0,Overall a great laptop with the best of features for the price.,The backlit keyboard was a must for me making it a better for a going blind person. As a retired Computer Simulation Interactor for the U.S. Army Dell was the top of the line brand at my old job.
