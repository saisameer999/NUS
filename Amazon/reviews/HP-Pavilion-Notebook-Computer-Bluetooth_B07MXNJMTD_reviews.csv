1.0,Raw deal.,"I bought an HP Laptop via Amazon, and it was DOA. After many minutes for the laptop to come on and screens came with errors: 0X0000052e. I was finally able to create my user, but with errors.  Errors, Errors, Errors, and no one to help from Amazon.  They accepted my a return, but forced me to pay the shipping."
5.0,Recommend! +++,"Always been an HP fan and needed one ASAP since I cracked the screen in my other. I love the numeric keypad on the keyboard, I didnt have that in my other. Also comes with disc player PLUS! And i was able to the needed storage space, I chose the 8gb. Setup was easy and I got a discount on McAfee for a yr!"
5.0,Great Product,Order  received on time. this is my third  HP Lap Top. Very comfortable with it
5.0,An excellent product.,"Arrived quickly and the seller was very communicative; also it arrived well-packaged.  A great value; a very nice laptop.  I had a Lenovo which died suddenly, and I needed a new laptop.  I have had HPs in the past and decided to return as they have always seemed to be quality equipment.  Perfect for my needs of internet access, email, etc.  I do not game so I cannot vouch for that aspect.  The most complicated thing I do with it is write my fandom novel on it and it is perfect for that type of activity.  Keyboard is responsive and quiet; the touch pad is taking some 'getting used to', but that is only because I am inept at that - I am more of track ball kind of user - so it is simply a learning curve for me to learn to tone down the sensitivity...I am getting better."
