5.0,Pleased with this purchase (genuine detailed review),"I needed a computer that I felt safe enough to carry around. I am a computer science student, currently attending grad school, and I already have a powerful macbook pro at home and have access to powerful imacs at school. I wanted to have something in my backpack, use it in class to test code, or in the library to read a textbook. The specification on this refurbished computer was more than I expected."
1.0,Solid state hard drive failed after two weeks - seller was unresponsive.  Don't buy.,"This computer was terrific - at first.  This was one of Dell's best Latitude designs (My company has been issuing us Dell laptops for the past 20 years - refreshed every 3 years with a new Latitude).  It was extremely fast, quiet, ran like a champ.  No bloatware was installed - just a lean version of Windows 10.  Was very happy."
5.0,Great device. Not sure where they get these but ...,"To be clear this is for a refurbished Dell Latitude E6430 sold by Laptop Experience.  Great device.  Not sure where they get these but it looked like new.  Had it for 1 week and so far so good.  I wanted something comparable to my work laptop which is a Lenovo Thinkpad T450 without paying for a new one.  Solid state hard drive was a must.  This one is smaller (128 vs 256) but I prefer speed over size.  Same processor.  This one is at least as fast or faster than the Lenovo (probably because its not weighed down with company security)  Startup was easy.  The vendor supplied some ""cheat sheets"" which made it easier and saves you from having to read the product key off the bottom.  Only negative is the packaging seemed thin for an such a device but it arrived un-damaged."
1.0,This computer was a piece of junk,"I was dis-sastisfied with this machine from the beginning. Taking it out of the box it looked old and tired.  I opened the DVD door and it was dirty inside and wobbly.  I had bought a machine from another supplier.  It was clean and looked new and i had to enter the 16 digit code from the bottom to engage the windows OS  This machine did not require that step and I'm not sure windows was even installed.  I suppose it was because the desktop had a blue backfield and the recycle bin icon.  I attempted to log in and at first i could not get the white, oblong enter password box to show up.  Finally after repeated attempts i got the box to appear.  BUT when i attempted to enter my password it said it was not recognized to try again.  I have 3 computers and use the same easy to remember password for all of them because no one else uses my machine.  I, per instructions on the card that came with the computer, sent a detailed message similiar to this one to their customer support.  It has now been 20 hours since i did that and still no answer so I simply sent it back to Amazon.  I have purchased 4 refurbs and this is the first that has been a problem.  I will make sure i dont purchase from this supplier again."
4.0,The computer arrived in excellent condition.,"The computer arrived in excellent condition...not even a scratch.  The computer is very fast but should have had a larger SSD drive. Also, there is no numeric keypad or CD Drive due to it having only a 14"" screen. Those are the only cons I have for this computer or I would have given it a 5-star rating!"
5.0,This was a great deal!,This came in quickly and appeared to be Like New. It performs flawlessly and the little bit of setting up was very easy and quick.
5.0,I never write a review when everything is fine with a product I buy,"I never write a review when everything is fine with a product I buy, but had to write this one. Figured I’d get this laptop & it would look used but was surprised how new it looks! No nicks, dents or scratches. Very clean. Fired right up , followed directions & it’s working great."
1.0,HORRIBLE!!!,HORRIBLE laptop and equal customer service!! Was for my nephew in college and hard drive crashed day 1. He called 3 times today and NO ANSWER. Would never recommend to anyone! Buyer beware!!!
1.0,Never got past the product key registration,I will never know if this was a good laptop because the product key was unteadable when scratched away from the sticker
4.0,99 I am very happy with this laptop,"I bought this computer and had received it almost as exactly as advertised, Here was what they were off about. The computer came with a windows 10 pro but the activation key it came with was a windows 10 home so I still haven't been able to activate my laptops windows 10 pro. I only recently found this out after many phone calls to different branches of the Microsoft company (who have been very patient and extremely helpful) and I have no idea how to contact the company I bought the laptop from to get the correct windows 10 pro key from. So aside from needing to buy a windows 10 pro activation key for $199.99 I am very happy with this laptop! Graphics are decent and the speed is incredible! plays Fortnite like a dream!"
5.0,Exceeded my greatest expectations,Amazingly exceeded my expectations..
5.0,LOVE IT!,"I had a similar computer (not Dell) that died finally and I bought another notebook brand. It was okay, but it died fast.  The notebook was too flimsy - didn't like the keyboard."
5.0,Like new laptop!,"The laptop I received is truly in “like new” condition!  I’m so glad I took a chance on this deal. For $263.00 I feel this laptop was a steal!  It is a little on the heavy side for a laptop, and the battery only lasts about 2.5 hrs.  I can certainly deal with the weight and battery run time, for the low cost and the performance I get with this laptop!  Thanks to the seller for this great deal (Sold by: Laptop Experience )!!"
5.0,Excellent Purchase,This Dell Latitude E6430 is a Fantastic Bargain!
5.0,"Great laptop at a super deal.  A fast machine, a workhorse.","Okay so I have purchased four Dell laptops and know them very well, so I was not disappointed this time either.  I always purchase SSD for my laptops, and this one had it installed already.  What a deal at only $289.  Worked out of the box, and I expect 2 to 3 years of service like my other Dells."
4.0,great except for sound,"After 4 months I'm still very happy with this refurbished Dell, it's solid, feels indestructible but sits comfortably on the lap.  It's fast starting up and moves easily from screen to screen.  I keep it plugged in most of the time but occasionally use it on battery and it doen't have the longevity that my old Lenova has, maybe a few hours, but sufficient for me."
5.0,My Wife is pleased.,My wife loves her new Dell. We've had several Dell laptops over the years and except for the one we had loaded with Vista they have all been good.
1.0,It's permanently stuck in airplane mode,"I've been trying to turn off airplane mode and turn on wifi all morning. It's a very strange thing--you drag the wifi button in settings from ""off"" to ""on."" And then you watch it slide right back to ""off"" before your very eyes."
5.0,Works as advertised,"The shipping was fast, and the laptop looks good.  A few dings in the the top cover, but the keyboard looks and feels new.  The only issue I have had with it, was that there were no instructions shipped with it to activate windows.  I didn't think to look on the bottom of the laptop, where the sticker is with the code.  But I sent the seller a message, and the they got back to me in few days with instructions.  No big deal, the laptop is working fine, and I am happy with it."
1.0,This computer was terrific.,This computer was terrific.
5.0,Rock Solid Performance & Condition,"I honestly could not tell this laptop was not brand new! As an experienced IT Security Pro I expected minor cosmetic marks and wear, some minor dust or use marks on the keyboard, etc but found nothing whatsoever to indicate prior usage."
4.0,What I wanted,This unit is perfect for what I need. The only reason I make it 4 star is that it's heavier than newer models and may have less storage space. However it's fast and functional. It came with Win 10 installed. I installed Ubuntu to make it a dual boot machine. There's more than enough disk space and I have no complaints.
5.0,... not a lot to say except that is a great value for the investment,"There is not a lot to say except that is a great value for the investment. I don't use it a lot, but even though it was refurbished it looks and performs like it came straight from the factory."
5.0,A great deal on a refurb-ed computer,I bought this Dell Latitude E6430 Laptop WEBCAM - HDMI - Intel Core i5 2.6ghz - 8GB DDR3 - 128GB SSD - DVD - Windows 10 Pro From TekReferbs through Amazon. It is exactly what i wanted and works well. The ordering was simple and fast. I recommend this company and this computer to anyone looking for a lot for their money.
5.0,"Perfect fit for use intended.  Clean refurb, no extraneous software","Works perfectly, case condition excellent and no bloatware installed upon receipt.  Even better than I expected for a refurbished computer.  Intended use is browsing, documents and other simple uses.  Perfect for the low end needs for these activities.  Priced to please."
5.0,Best value for money!!,This is by far one of the best used laptop I’ve bought. I have a 2018 MacBook Pro which was not cutting it due to its small 128gb storage. This laptop is as fast as (if not more) my MacBook. I had no issues with it and it came without any bloatware installed. Highly recommend if you need a secondary windows laptop or a coffee shop laptop.
1.0,Dell does not equal lenovo,"I purchased a dell laptop, they sent me a Lenovo.  Not sure if I will return it or not.  Makes me leery of the competence of the seller/re-builder."

3.0,Problem with battery life,"This product arrived quickly and in good condition, as described, but is useless as a ""laptop"" due to battery life. If not plugged in, the system shuts down in less than an hour. (Tasks are email, Google Drive, and internet searches.)"

5.0,Great buy,"I needed a laptop to replace one that quit working for my kids to do their homework on. I honestly bought this one because it was one of the cheapest that I could find, that being said it is faster and easier to use than the one I replaced it with. I’d definitely recommend it."
