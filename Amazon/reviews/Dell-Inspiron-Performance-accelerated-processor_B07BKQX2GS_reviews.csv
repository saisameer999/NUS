3.0,so you'll need to buy something like a Micro SD card with 32-64 gb,"For the price, can't complain. It's a tiny, light laptop. But I honestly think my phone is more powerful."
4.0,Great Option for Students and Casual Users at a Good Price Point BUT get a MIcro SD card!,"I am pleased with this device and use it for a few activities while on the road traveling: email, word processing and web surfing (videos).  This is great for students and the form factor is small so it is perfect for travel.  However, there is some work to get it going out of the box and if you are a technical person, you can make this system run well.  As a technical person myself, I will break up my review into 2 parts - a non-technical section and a technical section."
1.0,This was an unfortunate purchase,"This computer was purchased simply for the purpose of viewing the internet.  I added Google Chrome as it is necessary to view some of the sites.  This computer has a 32GB hard drive and is designed to run on Windows 10.  However, Windows 10 and all the ""accessories"" MS includes uses up 27GB.  It takes at least 8GB to install the Windows 10 update, so that can't be completed.  I don't know how long the computer will continue to function without updates but by the time I discovered this problem, the return window had closed.  Dell isn't the only company that is producing products with this problem.  This has been a very discouraging but educational experience."
5.0,Great buy!,"Laptop arrive really fast thank you Amazon Prime! Came brand new, loaded really fast with my WiFi and with several more connections I noticed once I saw it up close. Came with a cord and it also can connect to land line high speed internet as well. I also ordered the usb Ethernet adapter cable. The laptop is fast for new Dell. Great affordable deal new 2018 11.6 inch laptop. My apps loaded very fast as well"
1.0,No charger!,I can't believe this came without a charger
5.0,Works well for everything i need it for,"This laptop is very compact. I did have to buy an external harddrive to be able to keep all of my schoolwork with me. I use this to play minecraft, listen to music, and do schoolwork."
5.0,Five Stars,"Perfect for collage, performance is really good for the low price"
5.0,Its better than some of the reviews,"This is my updated review of this computer. In my first review I was quick to read other negative reviews. I tried most of the recommendations to make this machine what it is not, with little or no results. Plus I was frustrated with a small drive. When all that didn't work, I called Dell and this is how this product got upgraded to 5 Stars in my book. Dell tested the machine online with me on the phone and diagnosed a faulty motherboard, replaced it for free (shipping free as well) and now I have what the good reviews describe: a light weight, relatively fast, small laptop. I will say it does work better with 8gig of RAM and a 64gig storage. But nevertheless a good deal: good display and keyboard."
1.0,It’s slow,It was super slow and froze all the time. I was never able to actually get work done
5.0,"Awesome price-performance ratio notebook, if you set it up right","This notebook costs just ~140€ (!) and therefore your expectations must also be within the frame of this extreme budget price point. You will get what you paid for. This means that this notebook does have certain limitations and to make this ultra-low-cost device work properly you have to know a few things about how to set up a device running Windows 10 on just 32 GB of eMMC memory. The good thing is: It's not that hard. By the way, ""32 GB eMMC"" means: Buy an SD card too, it really is necessary!"
5.0,Good budget laptop for kids,"Good budget laptop for web browsing and light work loads, purchased it for a nephew and he is happy about it. No complaints so far."
1.0,Useless,"Absolutely the worst laptop I have ever owned. It is so slow the Web pages time out. When you close a tab or turn off sound a 45 second to 1 minute delay before it responds.  You can't adjust font at all. Only magnify the whole screen. Nothing is scaled to proportion.  Absolutely hate this product. This was bought for a back up in case my Acer went wonky. It is truly not usable in a work capacity.  You might be able to answer an email but it's going to tI me out a,few times while loading."
2.0,"Budget buy, budget performance.","Ok, so I've had this for about six months and I'm already needing a new computer."
1.0,Can I say P.O.S.?,"I have had this thing long enough to know it HAS to go back. I may be an ""Old Lady"", but I am FAR from an incompetent moron.. Got set up, connected to the net, attempted to do an update. Nope. The error I get says there isn't enough room to update Win10. ok. Meanwhile, EVERY time I have to restart, or am FORCED to restart, I get a CMainframe:updatefnlockicon Error, which I have been getting since I turned this P.O.S. on. Fun, huh?"
2.0,All I want is my Microsoft word to work. ...,All I want is my Microsoft word to work. I've used the computer 3 times since I got it. the start time is slow and my Microsoft Word doesn't open properly...
1.0,"Not 3.4GHZ, only 1.6","The only reason I bought this product was because the description said 3.4ghz, this ended up false. 1.6 is NOT 3.4 😒"
1.0,not a good laptop to access the internet,"Never ever buy one of these again. Very slow. Locks up all the time, not a good laptop to access the internet, I use it for an expensive door-stop."
2.0,"Started out great, was nearly inoperative a few days later.  Still not fixed.","Bought this as a music streaming computer, it works well enough, but needed updates. Could not process updates due to the 16gb onboard storage not being enough. Added on the SD card expansion, wouldn’t format. Finally got a format completed, couldn’t transfer files. Attempted updates again, and again it refused citing space requirements. Restore to factory, Windows now says not enough space to restore to factory and am unable to select any programs on start bar and start menu will not open. I am forced to open anything in the start menus through commands via Run. These machines have a purpose, just not the way I attempted to set it up. I recommend installing a good quality SD card of your choice, at least 64gb, prior to doing ANY updates and take the time to make sure your files save to said SD card first. This is likely where I goofed up and all but bricked my computer. My advice, if you want a small netbook style computer with small internal storage capacity for simple tasks, steer clear of anything running Windows. Chromebooks and Android based netbooks are best suited for this"
4.0,If you erase and place new copy of windows pro its fS,Not bad little laptop for my daughter.
2.0,Too Little memory on this C drive,"I purchased this inexpensive laptop dell computer just to access e-mail and internet when on vacation.  To do the initial updating of the windows 10 I first had to plug in additional memory source via the usb port.  That worked for some of the updates.... However on the second round of updates there was not enough space in the C drive to complete the needed updates.  I will say that the Dell support staff did very good at making additional space on the C drive however it is still only has 8.85 GB of space left.  And that is with me adding zero software to the computer.  So for me, I will keep it to access internet while on vacation.  But as far as a useful laptop computer, I can't recommend this one."
1.0,"Lack of Storage/ no accountability by any of the manufactures, distributers or Amazon!","This machine has all the latest bells and whistles!  Windows 10 etc.  the only problem is the machine came to me with very little storage space so much so that I cannot update Windows 10!  I am a a loss as to what to do at this point!  We all know how irritating it is when you get these automated update Windows messages, well this machine doesn't have sufficient storage to complete the update!! Furthermore I have contacted SOS Commerce, Amazon and Dell and no one wants to take responsibility for the lack of performance this machine provides. Help"
1.0,Not enough storage to run Windows 10 and store anything else,"I feel this is a group effort screw up. Windows 10 is way too big for even medium sized machines and this one is not big enough. I'd like to include Dell its this miss matched mess, too. When I called them to explain that a computer sold with Windows 10 should be big enough to handle more then just the operating system. I told Dell I wanted to get my money back, because they were the people who created this miss matched produce, making the end produced, in my eyes, ""Defective"" . They refused my request."
1.0,Too small for Windows 10 - failed after 1 month,"It worked great until it needed a Windows update. There wasn't enough GB to allow the update, however. We uninstalled everything so it was down to it's bare bones and it still didn't have enough spqace for the Windows update. People who put this computer together were morons. They should not have put Windows 10 on a computer that did not even have the minimum GB to allow for a Windows update. Without the update, the computer kept crashing after an hour of use. We owned it for 1 month and had no choice but to get rid of it. Total waste of money."
1.0,No Space for Bare Bones,"I was really digging this until I tried to voice train Cortana.  In order to do so I would have to free up space.  What?!  Free up space?!  Sure enough, after digging around here's where 32 gigs goes:"
2.0,Incapable of Computering,"I wanted to wait to review this item until I had had sufficient time to evaluate it.  It's been a couple of months now, and I've used it for hours and hours on a daily basis."
5.0,Works Wonderfully,Item works better than I thought and I am very happy with the price.
5.0,Good Deal!,"When I first received this computer, I somehow thought it would be a little larger. Please check the dimensions. I think this is the best, relatively low-priced PC laptop, that I have ever bought. Mine came with  Microsoft Office 2016 installed. I just had to activate the Microsoft Office one year subscription to make it work. I've mostly used Powerpoint. I am amazed by it. My computer came with a solid state hard drive. That was good, since I almost had an accident with it, but it seems to have come through it unscathed. The unit is small and doesn't come with a built-in CD/DVD drive, but seems to work well with a separate USB Dell CD drive that I purchased. (I see this as better because, it's been my experience, that built-in CD drives on low-cost computers sometimes don't always hold up the best.) The memory is small, but okay for my needs. The most wonderful thing about this machine is that, although the processor may not be the fastest, the computer seems to work like a good computer should. I give it five stars."
5.0,Great choice,Great for my kids.  I was looking for something good but economical for my kids to use.  This was perfect.  I has take a lot of abuse and works great!
1.0,Won't update even with extras,"I bought this mostly just to connect to my TV and watch Youtube video's and such.  I knew it's limitations but for what i needed it would be fine.  I ran into my first problem when I got a notification that it needed space to upgrade windows.  I couldn't delete enough things on the hard drive to get the space.  I tried plugging in a 64gb Micro sd card but it wouldn't recognize it.  I tried a 128gb thumb drive, wouldn't recognize it, I tried a 500 gb external hard drive, wouldn't recognize it.  I tried a factory reset, no help.  In essence it's not able to do anything.  I ended up giving up on it really.  Last time i used it was as a makeshift mousepad for the laptop i replaced it with in a pinch.  It was replaced for that duty with something better too.  DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,You get what you pay for,"Nice machine if you intend to use it for reviewing documents, or writing letters only."
1.0,Horrible!  Literally fell apart in a matter of months,"One of the screws holding this screen together popped - apparently it is just glued into a small plastic piece.  When this glue gives, the entire screen starts to fall apart.  After the first one, the pressure on the others quickly cause them to give as well.  Within a matter of days of the first, they all popped out.  I called Dell - this isn't something covered under warranty, even though I had the computer only 3 months.  I took it it a local repair shop - the cost of the repair was more than the cost of the computer.  My computer is now duct-taped together, and must have something behind it to keep the screen up.  I knew I was buying a cheap computer - but I didn't expect screws glued into plastic to be the downfall of this laptop."
1.0,There is insufficient memory for the basic operations,"I bought this on December 18, 2018 and now get messages that their is insufficent memory remoaining.  I do not have any pictures or downloads other then Microsoft Office.  The hard drive is actually solid state memory mounted on the mother board and cannot be upgraded. I was told by a retailer that the periodic upgrades to windows will take up more memory and soon their will be insufficient memory even for these necessary upgrades.  Perhaps Dell didn't figure out that this memory shortage would make the computer unuseable or Microsoft didn't give Dell estimates of near term memory needs.  I do not recommend this computer for anyone."
5.0,Good laptop for the money,"This is a pretty good laptop for the price . Booted up nicely and was easy to get it up and running. The only issue is that it doesn’t have much onboard  memory capacity. But, for the price I can deal with it with usb flash drives  and a external hard drive. I basically use this to surf the net, check emails and write papers for school."
5.0,I love this litte guy,"I bought this to travel with so I didn't have to bring my bigger, more expensive computer, and it's perfect for that. I've been using it for a few weeks now and I'm really happy with it. It's very small and lightweight, but not fragile. It's fast. The quality is great."
1.0,System Errors,Only out of the box for 1 hour and I have had this system error happen 2 times that forces my computer to restart.
5.0,Great laptop,excellent laptop has worked well above what I was actually expecting it too
4.0,Good liteweight for work or school use,The hard drive is only 27 gig so this is a good cloud based system. It's small and very portable. Not a high speed system but good for internet web browsing and office doc use. Too slow for gaming. I bought it for work and it's worth the price for work or school use.
4.0,Good little machine - buy an micro SD with ut!,"Pretty awesome little machine.  I did have to buy a micro SD card to actually get it going.  Not sure what that us about - how much more would it really be to add another 500mb to the hard drive to make it work?  Lame.  But once I got my card, it operates my CNC machine well."
1.0,Product works for short period of time and then breaks down,"Got this product for a Christmas gift.  It worked fine and everything was great.  It just stopped working and I cannot turn it on, there is no power and it's completely dead.  Tried everything.  Went to try to send it back or get it fixed and the window to do that had closed.  Didn't know that you could not get products for Christmas gifts and then the window closes immediately bc you bought it early.  This is my first Dell and it will be my last.  I should stick with products that have a good return policy and that have a reputation for working."
5.0,Great deal,I use it mainly for work. And checking emails perfect little computer to get the job done
4.0,Not a 2018 Dell but works great,"It can be a 2018 Dell Inspiron when it has programs from 2016,it's a small little computer but it does gets the job done,I'm using it for college classes."
2.0,Very slow,"We got this laptop at Christmas. It was almost instantly having issues. It runs super slow, freezes, won’t open windows and it crashed this week just 3 1/2 months after starting it up for the first time."
2.0,Very little memory capacity,"Whasnt what i expected, to slow to start, and small memory. Cant open 2 applications at the same time, with out slowing it."
5.0,All laptops have become cheaper because they are not loaded with a Microsoft programs.,A great computer for the price if you need to get online for school. Also another extra computer without a program like Microsoft which will be extra TO download should you choose to do so.
1.0,Space on hard disk,I was first impressed with the size of the laptop but I must say the hard disk is a disappointment. It already comes with a lot of installed files in the system taking almost all the space leaving room for very little to add on. I have used it for barely a month and I am being constantly reminded that I am low on hard disk space. I have no installed apps nor downloaded any personal stuff. It is very disappointing for me.
1.0,Don’t to business with,Not much value when the hard drive is dead and need to pay someone $300.00+ to repair or return and pay for all shipping and loss of money purchasing office after purchase And no replacement offered.
5.0,Perfect for Me,My favorite thing about this computer is the fact I can take it with me wherever I go. It works very well and my only complaint is that it is just solid black.... Well guess I am off to look for covers... Then it will be perfect😇🤓😁
1.0,No Way. Save your money for more space.,I hated it! It was the most disappointing computer I ever had. I mean if you are willing to pay all that money for the Memory then ok but as- is you can not use it. It freezes because it is too full.
1.0,CHECK THE KEYS ON THE KEYBOARD,"Product had a defect on the Keyboard...the ""@"" key was not functional as i kept getting an Apostrophe """" every time i pressed the @ key. Only to find out after checking all the keys that the apostrophe key and ""@ keys were incorrectly programmed."
4.0,Good for the price.,"Sure the laptop can be a little slow, but it’s a perfectly fine machine for doing basic things like working with Office programs."
2.0,No storage,"Has no storage space. Had it maybe a month with nothing downloaded to the computer except Google Chrome. I deleted all of the factory bloat ware. Windows 10 needed an update but it required me to free up 14.1 GB. I had nothing to delete or move to external storage. Couldn't even perform the update. If you need a very simple laptop for simply browsing the internet, it might work fine for you. Anything more, dont waste your money."
4.0,Under powered by decent laptop,"It is what it is. It's underpowered, you're not gonna do anything crazy on it, but it works for casual web browsing."
2.0,RIP OFF,"You have to pay for office, word, almost everything. I'll never buy dell again, notice the uncapitalized dell!!!"
3.0,"Not Impressed, even for the low cost","I’m finishing my masters and have no money so looked for a cheap option after my last laptop went on me.  I don’t need it for much so wasn’t scared there wasn’t much space on this P.C. however, it’s ridiculous.  I can’t even download the newest version on Windows, and I have nothing on the computer.  It’s extremely slow as well.  I’m going to go on it today and do what someone recommended in the reviews, as well as buy a new SD card.  Unless you are on a tighter budget then me, I’d say spend 50-100 more and get something a little better."
2.0,"Ok for the price, but...","Got this on Prime day. Was afraid it would be slow, but its fine. But today I tried to load Office and it said there was no room!!! Was not advertussd as reconfitioned ir snything, so I don’t understand why."
5.0,great laptop for the price if you just want something ...,great laptop for the price  if you just want something to do social media and surf the net.
1.0,No ethernet card,Unable to get internet nor online.
1.0,Not upgradable,Not upgradable  4 gb ram 32 gb ssd / windows 10 uses all the room up on hard drive / no place to down load any programs at all or updates for os.
1.0,Very bad,"I only used for half hour and it's very slow and not working good at all, not to mention the  package was wet and busted. I've been buying from Amazon for some time now and I'm very disappointed"
1.0,Product that's not lived up to what I bought it for.,"The vender packed and delivered the item on time. The product never worked correctly.  I had to download office 365 and register it online, I got an email confirming if was registered and working when l log off but when I tried using it,it states I have to go online to register it again. i don't have internet where i am now so i can't use it for what I bought it for at this time."
1.0,DON’T Buy! Worst Computer I’ve Ever Owned!,"This is a piece of junk. Don’t buy! My 11-year-old is very disappointed. She’s online trying to research for her science fair, and it’s too slow. We knew immediately it was a waste when we set it up. Had I not already opened the box, I would be sending it back. I’d recommend Dell to remove “Flagship” from its name. If this is their “Flagship,” then the company is in a sad state."
2.0,Slow,This labtop is slow right out of the box wouldn't recommend to anyone
2.0,Hinge broke,My husband leaves his laptop on his desk. It rarely moves. He used it one night and the hinge broke so now it won't close. We bought it for Christmas and it's only the beginning of March.
5.0,Gift,Got for my son
1.0,"Either Not as good as others say, or I got the short end of the stick,","It's slow. It is so slow, that I can't even open a window without it freezing for a good eight seconds. Not to mention the random black screens. And it'll start freezing up if I just hold backspace and I delete a couple words. I'm a writer, I bought this laptop so I could write and maybe listen to music. Maybe I just happened to get a bad version of this laptop? I don't know. But I'm pretty disappointed. Wasted a lot of money on this laptop."
2.0,Gets to hot,"I want to say that as far as condition, how quick I recieved it was  5 star it's  the laptop  it gets  really hot right away.  All I  did was turn it on and go through set up and could not hold it. I'm  disabled and wanted to be able to place in my lap to work and couldn't keyboard sticks also"
3.0,Worth the price,Product is as advertised. You get what you pay for. I needed something simple and this is the basic. A bit slow but again for the price it’s great.
5.0,Five Stars,As expected.
1.0,Not able to store anything on this computer,I can't believe anyone would sell a computer with the low storage capacity that this computer has.  It has enough capacity to run and that is it.  I am not even able to download the updates to the computer because the C drive takes up all the space.  Beware.
1.0,Not worth it,This is the second one I purchased and this one isn’t working either . I is stuck at signing off status.
1.0,Terrible Purchase,"I purchased this for my daughter, and it is a terrible computer.  The operating system takes up almost 100% of the memory and the computer is worthless.  I can't even use the additional memory card that I installed for the memory.  I have been fighting this for weeks, and now its too late to return.  DON'T buy this computer.  Its just not worth the expense and headache!"
1.0,You get what you pay for.,After a couple of windows uodates there was no room to install any programs. I thought I could upgrade the drive. Through lots of research and ultimately trial and error I found that the there is no hard drive. It uses a built in flash type of drive that is not upgradable. Had I known I would have not purchased this machine. I can’t imagine who this machine was designed for. Maybe a sucker?
4.0,Works,Works well had to buy extra storage. Bought refurbished can't tell. Came with everything and looks new.
5.0,Fantastic little Computer,I bought it as a backup and it literally cloned itself to the mothership. It's fantastic.
4.0,"Budget Laptop: Slow with Windows (due to default configuration), faster with Linux, still meant for basic use","I bought the laptop in order to install and learn Linux on it locally. The laptop runs smoothly on the Linux distro I installed (CentOS), which was able to detect my Wifi network, connect to my bluetooth headphones, and was relatively fast for its specs."
3.0,Sum trouble,"Couldn't open up Anything one day, had trouble charging one day. It's good for the money, and it's used by my daughter. So I guess ok for now."
2.0,😔😔😔 no good,No good
1.0,Not worth the money at all,The laptop only lasted 2 month before it stopped working. I have downloaded anything besides for chrome. That shouldn’t be able to slow a computer down and I know it can’t be my internet because I have the fastest internet verizon offers in my house.
5.0,Love it,Nice little computer. Not much memory. But works good for research
5.0,LOVE THE SERVICE,LOVE THE SERVICE! JUST DON'T LIKE WINDOWS 10. NOT YOUR FAULT THOUGH. THE COMPUTER WORKS WELL. PURCHASE OTHER ONE IF I WOULD HAVE WINDOWS 7.
1.0,It was broken,"I opened it and parts of the keyboard were missing, the screen didn't work, there was no charger either. I tried to get a refund but it was no use they refused to let me."
1.0,Died after 4 months!,"Only used on Sundays. After only 4 months it will not boot up. Gave it to a IT person, was told he could not repair."
1.0,No no no no no,Out of the box and would not work memory too low. Why sell it.....
3.0,I would it buy this again,It sucks this product sucks
5.0,"Easy to use, great screen. Great for the price.","Easy to use, clear screen. Good price."
5.0,Good for younger kids,Great for my 9 year old
1.0,hinges connecting screen,the hinges that connect the screen with computer broke now i cant use it. this is the third computer that i have bought
5.0,Good little net book for srudent!,My son is enjoying this works well!
1.0,Does not have enough memory to run,This computer stopped being able to update windows after the first update and that is after uninstalling everything that I could uninstall and having nothing saved at all on the computer.  I thought I could run it with a flash drive but it doesn't work.  A complete waste of $200.
5.0,Not a standard size laptop,I wish I would have known it was a micro size laptop. But I've seen the word laptop I thought of the standard laptop but it was not. It still gets the job done
1.0,Not high performance at all!,The computer is very slow.Freezes all the time.I wonder if I have been scammed!😥
1.0,Broke after three months,"The computer broke after three months. I could not return it to Amazon, so I called Dell for help. They told me to ship it to them so they could fix it, and then  they billed me over $200 to fix it. I paid less than that for it brand new.I told Dell that I would never buy Dell ever again."
1.0,Not happy,I bought this for my daughter for her birthday.  Gave it to her on November 3. It is November 14th and the laptop has quit working already. We cannot get it to turn on at all.
3.0,Worked fine every thing I needed for just school work. Now it does not work.,Has anyone's laptop stopped working? When I turn on it just shows the saved screen. I only use this for school. I have only had it for 1 month.
1.0,Terrible. I mean really bad.,"This is the worst of the worst. We usually have great luck with dell and on amazon however this is the slowest ever! Do not buy, I wish we would have returned it in time but my husband was too nice to tell me how terrible it was."
1.0,Needs more storage!!,I’m sure it is my fault but there isn’t very much internal storage on this laptop!! Didn’t realize when I bought it!
1.0,Please send me new unit,Unit will not hold a charge at all
5.0,Very sastified,Good product
1.0,No space!,Very disappointed! Will never purchase another Dell!
1.0,piece of junk,it died in the 1st week
4.0,Can't go wrong with the price.,Works great.
4.0,Has very low memory out the Box,Not a lot of storage at all comes pre packed with a lot of stuff you don't need and cannot take off Good for kids
3.0,Very light.,"It's very light, and good for online work. However the storage is way too small, and it updates alot. I currently have no apps installed since I do everything online and it shows that my storage is almost full. It's good for it's price I just prefer there wasn't so much updates."
5.0,Awesome,Great compact computer
5.0,Super excited about it,I am super surprised with this purchase.
5.0,i want another and probably buy again :},"loved also this product is missing at the moment lol.... great product, careless owner :P"

5.0,Great price,Great product
1.0,Bad,Very very very bad
1.0,Do not buy this,This is false advertising.Also no memory.Can not update windows even.The N key sticks
1.0,I wouldn't recommend at all.,Doesn't have enough storage to make updates and it's been barely used
3.0,Better material and clearer picture,Could be more durable with better screen display.
5.0,Good for kid,Comes full have to delete stuff to down load anything
2.0,Good price for item but charger was defective,I thought the product was decent for the price. I didn't want something expensive as I just needed the lap top to type up papers for school. The charger stopped working about a month in and that is why I am giving it 2 stars.
1.0,Poor construction,Purchased this computer in September and it is already done. It’s hinge on the one side got jammed up and when it got closed it popped the entire screens frame off and now it barely closes and if you open it the frame breaks more.
1.0,dying after 3 months of use,This computer's memory is so poor . I had to stop allowing updates- due to a lack of available space.
1.0,Not worth the money.,"Battery stopped working, and it says not enough memory even though I didn’t store anything."
5.0,Good,Good
4.0,Storage is inadequate,"Not ideal for playing games, which was my intention. The storage is not enough to hold any apps other than what is already on the computer. But it is a great little computer for the price! I would reccomend it to anyone needing a little laptop for schoolwork."
1.0,Trash item and bad customer service,I bought this laptop and it was defective I tried getting a refund and amazon and dell denied I’m going to get my refund because I don’t pick up money of the ground even if I have to go around them to my credit union.
1.0,Too Slow and Power kept turning off.,"Powered the laptop and kept on shutting down, then once I had to up the processor was too slow. When it finally kept on shutting down again over, and over again we sent it back . We must of got one of the Lemons from Dell."
