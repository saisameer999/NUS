4.0,Perfect for kids/teens and seniors,I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.
5.0,Easy to set up,The Acer Aspire 5 was the easiest computer that I ever set up. It took only a few minutes with the promptings of Cortina. The only thing that I had to have was my WiFi pass code. I was asked to make decisions about what I wanted the various programs to take care of for me. An example was a question about saving sites I visited and advertising for me.
5.0,"Quick, good price, excellent for gaming/movies","Seven months ago, my favorite Dell laptop died its final death after 6 years of service. I loved that laptop, as it was the first touchscreen laptop of its kind and helped me in my work with special needs children."
4.0,Great laptop with two problems,"This is a great laptop, with two problems. First, the hard drive is obnoxiously small. What is it with laptops still offering such paltry amounts of storage? It's absurd in 2019."
