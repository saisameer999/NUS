1.0,Highly disappointed and too embarrassed to give it to my mom ...,"This chromebook is not a “nice refurb”. It’s been abused, dropped, scratched, etc. Highly disappointed and too embarrassed to give it to my mom for Christmas."
1.0,"Received the ""referbished"" laptop with excessive signs use. Blown ...","Received the ""referbished"" laptop with excessive signs use. Blown speaker. The border of the screen was also peeling upward. The Samsung logo is also missing off the front of the laptop.  Buyer beware."
5.0,Great little machine,"Bought this machine because I needed a quick and cheap word processing computer when my aged Netbook died.  Completely exceeded my expectations, firstly by being indistinguishable from new.  It came in a Samsung branded box, had the original power adapter, and was free of any signs of previous use.  No charge in battery.  Plugged it in, signed in, and began to use it.  Very comfortable keyboard, nice looking screen.  The Chromebook experience is great.  So long as you have WiFi, you have access to the whole world of web applications.  Why use your own computer when you can use Google's?"
1.0,... received the chrome book and it works but its horribly scratched and looks so well worn,"I received the chrome book and it works but its horribly scratched and looks so well worn, can’t return it because it’s a Christmas gift. Very disappointed in the condition that it arrived in."
5.0,Great little laptop,"Great little laptop. Really worth it. Its nothing to much as in features, just google, but when you rely on your phone or tablet to do day to day work, its nice to have something with a real keyboard.  After 24hrs playing with it, its quick, the battery lasted the whole day with off and on use after a full charge. it has 2 usb ports, 2 memory card readers, and my favorite a HDMI port (you can hook it up to a TV and close it) Great for non-app web videos. Its really thin and lightweight and its small without being too small, ya know? I would totally recommend this."
5.0,Perfect first computer for a 12 yr old/ 6th grade,"Perfect first computer for a 12 yr old/ 6th grade.  Only issue is I didn't realize you couldn't do some things like Skype on it-- but then my son figured out how to do that after all.  Great camera-- light weight computer.  He also wanted to play clash of clans on it, but tough.  This is for school/ typing/ research/ etc-- and it's a great computer for that."
1.0,Screen quality is terribly blurry. Returned immediately,Junk.  Used much harder than they want you to believe! Screen quality is terribly blurry.  Returned immediately.
5.0,Chromebook is an Excellent Lap Top,"I received the product early and in perfect condition. I have been working with lap tops for the past 20 years and find the chromebook to be fast, extremely light weight and a joy to use.  I am so pleased with this unit that i bought a second one to give to my daughter. I have also recommended the chromebook to three of my friends who have also purchased the chromebook and are as pleased as I am with this product."
5.0,LOVE,"I adore this laptop!!! It runs fast, and its light weight. This laptop does everything perfectly. The only thing I didn't like about it at first is I didn't know how to right click. I figured it out though. Instead of touching the touchpad one for a normal left click, touch the touchpad with both fingers and it works just the same as a normal right click on a mouse. Needless to repeat, I LOVE THIS LAPTOP!!"
1.0,Awful,I'd give it a 0 if I could.  No camera icon. Couldn't access the camera.  No word app. Received it with the sd card slot broke.  It's horrible.
1.0,I am not happy that I had to pay shipping back for something ...,"This is the second one that I have ordered, first one did not work at all and I returned.  This one the computer works but the charger did not.  So I returned charger and am still waiting to get a replacement charger to me.  I am not happy that I had to pay shipping back for something that has been non working twice.  I just wish I knew status of getting a replacement charger and a refund on shipping.  Can't use a computer that you can't charge....."
1.0,"Not Certified Refurbished, Its USED JUNK!","9/7/18 WARNING! Do not buy, I read all the reviews and still decided to buy it. My thinking was maybe they had fixed the problem. I was wrong, it was the junk everyone else posted. I looked at the pics and I believe they just keep sending the same one back out."
5.0,Great deal!,Lighter (in weight) than expected which is great.  Looks like new.  Works very well.
5.0,My Second Samsung Chromebook!,"Purchased a new Samsung Chromebook from Amazon, over 5 years ago.  It was used daily until I  accidentally knocked it off a desk, fatally damaging the screen.  Found and purchased another laptop exactly like my other for a very reasonable price, from  Amazon, which I've been using for a week.  The only difference has been battery hours, which just may need more frequent charging.  Other than that, it looks and responds like a new laptop and I am thrilled to have my favorite source, Samsung Chromebook, alive and well within my grasp again!"
5.0,Terrific bargin,Very pleased this was for. My grandson that’s handicapped and is very good with his electronics but we don’t want to. Spend a lot of money he loved this computer and thank you for making it available fo him
1.0,One Star,Software no good
1.0,Heavy cosmetic wearing was covered with a sticker !,"I got a refurbished one ,the screen is fine but the outside show's heavy wearing so much that they covered the front and back with a gray sticker."
5.0,Very easy to use,"It looks brand new. Absolutely no marks on it anywhere. Very easy to use. I would definitely get another one if I lost or broke this one. I would totally recommend this to anyone looking for a Chromebook/Laptop, etc."
2.0,Into the Trash this Went,"I was so excited about this, when I bought it. I was going to buy a cheap laptop that would do anything!"
4.0,It took some getting used to but once I learned all the quirks and shortcuts it was a great laptop.,When I ordered it I didn't realize a chromebook was different than a regular laptop.  It took some getting used to but once I learned all the quirks and shortcuts it was a great laptop.
5.0,Excellent product at affordable price,"I am always very skeptical about ordering refurbished products; however, this company followed through with their advertising of certified refurbished. I purchased the chrome books for my kids because there are specific programs they use in school on chrome books and I wanted them to be able to access the programs from home. The chrome books I received look brand, battery life is excellent, and my kids love them. They even said these are nicer than the ones they use at school."
1.0,Oops! I think y'all forgot something..,"I really liked my Chromebook, but all I received with my package was the notebook and nothing else! No user manual or anything to help me understand how to use it! I'm a senior and I'm quite ignorant to navigating my way around in a computer so I was looking forward to learning.. Not only that but the 2nd time I went to use it, the screen part which surrounded the screen fell off.. It liked as tho somebody glued it on and it just fell off so now I have a defective device and no understanding of how to use it!! Very dissatisfied, but I would like to have a replacement sent with instructions PLEASE!"
1.0,Never buying refurbished again,"I received my laptop Sunday, it arrived on time. I opened it Monday to find out that my screen was messed up. The visuals on my screen are completely off. The colors look neon. I cant read half the things I try to. This was a horrible purchase."
4.0,My fault,"I should have read more about this product first.  Not iPhone/iTunes compatible, total waste of money for me."
5.0,Totally surprised!,"I'll be honest, I was nervous about receiving my chrome book as I've read some pretty harsh reviews and seen photos that made me nervous about my purchase but I've gotta say, when I received mine, it's in beautiful shape, the screen is great, no scratches or dents all the buttons work, and the only thing I noticed was a faded black streak under the screen where the fold is but it's nothing to scare me off or barely noticeable! I love this laptop and I am SO happy I got it! I needed one for school and it came right on time! Thanks a lot I appreciate you sending me a great laptop! Highly recommend and great value!"
4.0,Get a List - gift shopping for family,So I made a Christmas gift mistake on StarTrek whom he wanted Star Wars.
1.0,Not worth the money,"There’s nothing positive about this product, beat up really in bad condition, including charger."
4.0,Four Stars,"Great, clean 'as new' would buy again.  Shipping came in before date indicated!  Thanks!"
1.0,Mousepad DOESNT WORK!!!!,"I ordered this for my autistic daughter who HAS to have a laptop!  It turns on fine but the mouse pad doesn't work.  You can scroll around, but can't push on it.  Clearly the seller knew that it didn't work. The finish on the nse ouse pad was all worn,  I wish i had know before I gave it to my daughter and she had a meltdown."
4.0,Good Product,I was about to return this because of the not so good reviews. I'm glad I did not because it has been helpful in my search for a new job. I couldn't tell if it's refurbished because it works without a hitch.
5.0,I really like this laptop,I really like this laptop. It's extremely light compared to my old one which makes or a lot easier to carry around and the battery really does last an extremely long time. And the best part is it doesn't get really hot when in user for s long period of time like most laptops.  I like how it automatically starts up when you open it and I can't even tell is refurbished. It's just the size I wanted but I wish there was a color option. I've heard people say it can't download games but I specifically use it for business purposes so it's just fine for me.
4.0,I like it!,Computer was as advertised and arrived in good condition.  Works great and is fast!
4.0,Great deal for my needs!,"I was skeptical of this at first because of the bad reveiws, but I took the risk, and I am thrilled with it! I dont need anything fancy, just the basics and this fits my needs perfectly! Arrived packaged well, no extra damage done. Screen is perfect, overall in great condition, only damage from previous owner was a few scratches by the headset plug in, and a little damage to the sd card holder. Seeing as how I rarely need these, it doent matter to me any. I love it, and it was a steal for my needs. It replaced my old, 15 year old laptop that was full of viruses, so I would drfinitly recomend this product of you just need the basics and dont want anything too fancy :)"
4.0,Four Stars,"I like my new chromebook put i wish i had the instruction book, my device works great"
5.0,turned out to be a good deal. I did have to buy a new ...,reliable and undamaged. turned out to be a good deal. I did have to buy a new charger..I think it was 14 bucks on Amazon..because the one sent was bent...I did not want it to break off in the device. The important thing is now I have all the features I wanted for a decent price.
1.0,Not as advertised. Damaged and not working,"Looks pretty beat up. The screen has some permanent damage of wear and tear which I was not warned about. The battery life seems to be waning already. And the keyboard is messed up. Can’t hit keys without getting double of each letter I type, and the number keys don’t work. This is absolutely unacceptable. And not useable. Would love to give zero stars"
4.0,"Could have been cleaner, but functional otherwise.","Overall, the laptop functions as expected, the battery holds a charge and it had minimal cosmetic imperfections. I would have liked for it to have been cleaner however. The keyboard and keypad were grimy and crusty, making it necessary for it to all be cleaned before I could even test the functionally."
1.0,Defective,"This chrome book won’t even turn on completely. It just flashes on and right back off again. I’m quite disappointed by the condition as well. There is paint or something on it, and it’s missing the G in Samsung on the cover. The cord also has a damaged spot that looks melted."
1.0,Dont buy this,Piece of crap.  You cannot download apps because google play does not recognize it.  Bought it for college wasted my money.  Throwing the damn thing away and getting a better laptop when financial aid comes in.
5.0,Pretty good so far,"So far, so good. I needed a very simple-to-use computer, without a lot of apps and ads, that I could take everywhere. I've only had it for a few hours and it's doing everything I've asked. It also connected to my bluetooth capable printer and my bluetooth speaker. I downloaded the Amazon Prime app and watched a movie with no glitches so far."
1.0,Useless,"I wasn't able to use the laptop. Right out the box the bottom was ready to fall apart, but I thought it would be ok. Then I tried to log in & it said it was managed by an administrator that has to give me access. There was an option to contact Google for help with a website. Google  offered 2 options get permission from the administrator or return the item. It's basic common sense to remove passwords and necessary access from a device before selling it. Returning it now."
1.0,Defective product,Dead on arrival.  It was defective when it arrived.  It was defective for the previous owner as well.  My package arrived with all information of the previous buyer inside.  Amazon just turned around and sent it to me.
5.0,First Time Chromebook user,This is my first time owning a chrome notebook. A little disappointed that it doesn’t have a dvd/cd Drive I am getting use to having it.
4.0,Very nice computer. The only reason i give it 4 ...,Very nice computer. The only reason i give it 4 stars is for three reasons:1. Arrived a little late
5.0,NICE!!,"This little laptop is in great condition, charged up really quick and has no visible damage. Looks almost brand new! Came packaged really well and clean and neat. I had a chrome book for 4 years and it finally died, but this one just picked up where mine left off.  Very happy with this purchase!"
5.0,Best Chromebook ever,This was our first experience with chromebook and I have to say it is so much better and faster than regular laptops.  The price was great and it works so good.  No issues or problems at all.  Nice to get something refurbished and it really work.
1.0,Beat up and broken when received. Returned,"The packaging was great, so it wasn't damaged in shipping.  The latch was broken.  Chips out of the paint.  Scratched up. Wouldn't connect to WiFi. I returned and bought new.  Definitely wouldn't recommend refurb"
5.0,Cheap and works really well for most of your needs. Always being improved as well.,"When I first got it was a little difficult get connected with the apps I wanted, but just found I can print on a HP printer and use Spotify. Works great with Google word, pwrpt, and sheets. Really helped with typing papers for college, surfing the web, and watching videos. It's such a good purchase especially for the price."
5.0,I really really like my new laptop,I really really like my new laptop. It's small which is what I was looking for and makes it very portable. I didnt know what to expect because I have never had one and also since its a chromebook I am very happy.
5.0,Good for the price,Bought for my son to work on his math. Got it refurbished and I can't even tell it's not brand new. It's basically a big mobile phone so you can't play any games out side of a browser.
5.0,Surpassed my expectations!!!!!,I love my google chrome book.  I had never used one and it is so so easy and user friendly and just exactly what I needed and more.  It works amazing. So easy to carry and take from office to class to home. Wow.  Thank you so much.
1.0,"Trash, Don't waste your time!!","Product arrived in a box7sizes too big, box felt as if it had been sitting in the sun for 3 daysl and open.  SSD door broken off.  Item. WIFI did not work.  Screen booted half way and then fully.  A real piece of junk."
3.0,VERY DISSAPOINTED,"The first thing I noticed after opening the box was that my computer was not wrapped in bubble wrap. Only a little bit of paper. I could feel it shifting as I carried it into my home. When I got it open, Immediately saw the dirty looking condition. I had to get a damp cloth to wipe off the outside due to the fact my hands got dirty just taking it out of the box. Afterward, I could see what appeared to be clear nail polish or glue around and on the mousepad. I managed to get it off with a tile cleaner. Although it seems to be working fairly well, I cannot express my distaste in the condition it was delivered. That is why I am SUSPENDING my Amazon Prime. A review of the company that supplied this needs to be done!"
5.0,Please send instructions it would help,I didn't like it at first it has no paper work how it works.The color was all blue and black. I was going to send it back . But I took it to Office Deposit and a very nice young man . Adjusted the settings for me.  I like it  wish I has
5.0,It's works great. Set up and installing parental controls was a ...,"This was purchased for my 13 year son. He loves it. It's works great. Set up and installing parental controls was a breeze. He barely puts it down, and when he does, I like using it, as well."
5.0,Looks great and a perfect size,Just got it today. It's for my grand daughter's birthday this month.he wil be using it for school next year. Looks great and a perfect size.
2.0,Slow,"I loved it at first because it has some cool features. But what I dont like is that it is slow. When i have it connected to Wi-Fi, even excellent signal, the Wi-Fi cuts in and out. Doesn't matter where in am, what wifi im connected to, hooked to an Ethernet cord,... Nothing works. I tried everything I found online to fix it and nothing..."
4.0,but overall it’s a good school computer,"Had some trouble the first day I had it, but overall it’s a good school computer. Customer service was very courteous and helpful."
5.0,Happy Customer,"So far, this product works great, and it was delivered in a very timely fashion.  I recommend them both!"
5.0,Five Stars,"Product was in good condition, & I was surely satisfied with my purchase. Reasonably priced as well!!"
1.0,Need refund. Will find something else,Kids can not use this for home school. And i did not see rebuibise anywhere. Said new. So what happen. My niece  is gonna be contacting you. I sent these to north Carolina
1.0,It arrived in very bad conditions,"It arrived in very bad conditions. The chromebook arrived completely ruined, full of scratches and run down. It doesn't work as it should and I had to take it to repair spending a lot of money"
2.0,poor battery life,In the specs it claims 7 hour battery life.  I am only getting about 3.  I am contemplating sending it back since the battery will be almost as expensive as the cost of product.  There is a wear mark (paint rubbed off)  where the batter is located and gets pretty warm to the touch.  I bought this one because my older chromebook lost its mouse pointing ability.  Other than that a great product.
2.0,"Sucks, hard to set up apps","Sucks,hard to set up apps,and tutorial not much help"
2.0,Good,Does the trick for a young teenager. Only bad thing is the speaker is HORRIBLE

4.0,Great Chromebook while I had it,"Great Chromebook while I had it! Caution if you leave on the roof of your car it will fly off never to be seen again. Yes I have personal experience with this, unfortunately!"
1.0,Worked great for a few hours,Sadly this unit irretrievably seized up and will need to be returned.
1.0,Bad deal?,"It didn't work!! The cord did not fit. How can I expect the ""refurbished computer"" to work when I didn't even get the correct cord!!"
2.0,no touch creen,Bought two for the twin grandsons birthdays.
5.0,my mother,I know my mother got it on day it was supposed to be there. Other then that am not sure of. Am waitting to find out if it is working for her.

1.0,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!,"Needed as a second laptop for kids school, figured great price. But, you get what you pay for. This is crap. Ordered this TWICE! First time wrong charger, broken missing plastic from charging port, sticky charger (ew). Sent it back same day. Second order, wrong charger, sticky charger (EW!) Sending the second one back today."
5.0,18 month warranty it comes with for free,Fast shipping and set up was a breeze. I  have only had it for 1 day but it’s a great chrome book. I lan on buying another one for my father next month.
5.0,Samsung Chromebook,"Works great, battery is long lasting and easy to carry because its so light, and progams are very user friendly."
1.0,Decepción,Llegó rota producto devuelto además se veía súper usada
2.0,Works good but looks pretty rough,Nice little laptop. It works great for what we needed but this was to be a gift for my son and it was by no means gift worthy from a refurbished perspective. Lots of dings scratches chipped paint etc. So while it works well so far it is a pretty rough looking laptop
5.0,Only working with google chrome,"Very beautiful Chromebook hardware,easy to handle. I hope the software is very good too."
4.0,As far as it being renewed..its in great shape. a few scratches  but hardly noticeable..happy so far,I bought this for my 10 year old daughter for her birthday and she was soo excited..we havent had it long enough yet to get a full effect of what all it does..i noticed touch screen was one of the ratings but i dont think it has touchscreen..if it does we havent used it yet

4.0,Good Laptop!,I brought this laptop for my daughter. She loves it. The screen quality is good.
2.0,very obviously used scratch,"look the picture,😖 big scratch.it looks already be used long time! a little disappoint!"
1.0,TERRIBLE,Wish I could give 0 stars!! Not only is this extremely scratched up but it will not charge. Or turn on for more than a few seconds bc there is no battery charge and it just shuts off. Have tried charging the battery for a few hours and the most I get is 1% then it shuts off again.
5.0,Look correct and near new,Past pleased i hoping everyone else going forward has the same experience
5.0,Easy to charge and takes a while to finish.,"I haven't found a dislike. Not having officially used it yet, more than checking out the screen and the typing, it is perfect. I saw scary reviews about bad scratches, screen problem, keyboard, and battery life problem, I think, what was I fretting for??? My chrome book is soooooo nice and it could pass for a new one. Plus, it is easy to charge and takes about 7 or so hour before emptying."
1.0,USELESS GET YUORSELF  A NICE TABLET,NEVER BUY A CHROME BOOK BUY A REAL COMPUTER Even on a lay way!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,Not happy at all!!!,"I was initially very excited to have my unit for my employee.  But once I looked at it carefully, it is awful.  The power connection cord is very, very loose.  So loose to the point that the unit will cut off and it took a few minutes for me to power it up again.  I think Amazon should take a little more time reviewing and inspecting an item before putting it back out for sale.  Very disappointed Amazon!"
5.0,Wonderful Mobile Laptop/Chromebook!,Great Chromebook! Very effective for using on an everyday basis. It is not for gaming....but at my age...I am not into gaming. Light weight and easy to carry.

1.0,Horrible quality.,"I ordered 4 of these. One mouse pad don't work, another screen cuts out when I open it more than half way. They are scratched up and some parts are cracked. I emailed the seller and still haven't got a response. I wouldn't buy from there again or reccomend them to anyone else. I understand they ar  ""refurbished"" but I didn't think they would be this bad."
1.0,Do not buy!,I meeded a new computer amd this is the 2nd one i have gotten that i am sendimg back. The mouse pad does not work on either chromebook so on the 2nd one i plugged a mouse into to try to get it to work but it was not wiped properly so it thinks it has another owner.

1.0,Do not purchase,"I brought 2 for my older kids as a Christmas gift. We received them with scratches and dents. 1 laptop would not charge correctly on the charger provided, at this point my kids are sharing a charger. 3 months later neither laptop works anymore screens are blacked out, both  laptops are falling completely apart.

1.0,Waste of money basically,"It came in early. When I received it, part of the screen was kinda peeling off. It worked though! So that didn’t bother me as much. It worked for about 3 weeks and then gave out. I turned it on one day and a screen came up saying OS was damaged or broken. I tried several attempts to fix the os by installing it but it never worked."

1.0,Waste of Money,Horrible I can tell the top is a sticker...has scratches everywhere...button sticks and to takes too long to process stuff .....this was a disappointment
1.0,2014 was a long time ago in the computer world,"Don't know. It was somebody's old, used Chromebook they probably traded in for a new one. Never even turned on."
3.0,Ok laptop,"Good product,but seller should have mentioned that battery is dead!"

3.0,As a starter/student laptop its fine. However,"As a starter/student laptop its fine. However, since you can only use Google Chrome extentions you are limited. Constricted. Probably the most practical applications for Chromebook are Google Docs and Google Sheets."
1.0,Nooooo,It is not a regular laptop my child can’t play his games on it and also some
1.0,Pues de importante nada prq Ay muchos pedidos que no me los an entregado ni me devuelven mi dinero,No me agrada para nada mandaron una conputadora toda rayada y usada

1.0,Very disappointing Purchase,"I received the Chrome Book timely, unfortunately the seller sent the wrong plug. Once I located the correct plug, I found the keyboard wasn't working. I'm not sure what type of QA process the seller has, but it definitely is not effective."
4.0,So far so good!,Read many complaints about these refurbished chrome books. Mine arrived looking pretty much new. Very slight ding in one corner but hardly noticeable or an issue for the price. Your mileage may vary but so far I am please. Purchased for my 12 yr old daughter/6th grade.
