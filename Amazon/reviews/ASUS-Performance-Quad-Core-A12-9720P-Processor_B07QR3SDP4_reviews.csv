5.0,Pretty decent gaming laptop.,Pros:
5.0,Works great! This laptop runs all my elder scroll games,"Works great!  This laptop runs all my elder scroll games,saits row 4, and fallout 4.  Fallout 4 though has to be on the lowest graphic setting or it crashes but that's fine with me since I'll be getting a desktop for more high performance gaming."
5.0,This replacement is great. No touch screen,"Had a Lenovo touch screen that after two years I gave up using.  This replacement is great.  No touch screen, but that really was not useful for everyday school work."
5.0,Five Stars,As described
4.0,An almost-but-not-quite perfect laptop,"Overall this is a very nice laptop, but there are a few frustrating drawbacks that make it less than perfect. I've had it for 4 months and I use it for animation and vfx, running hardware hungry programs like Cinema 4D and After Effects."
5.0,and got worse over time,"It's a very powerful laptop, definitely worth the money I spent on it. Powers through many computationally heavy tasks and gaming. My graphics card died after just about a year of use, so I RMA'd the unit and got a motherboard replacement free of charge (thanks Asus!). Another concern is the battery life. It lasts just 2 hours of use off the battery, and got worse over time. Eventually (a year and a half) the battery just refused to charge, so I had to buy a replacement. If you intend to use this for studying etc, I would recommend bringing the charger. For LAN parties and hackathons though, it's great. The screen is pretty cheap, the colors are quite ""washed out"". For my needs (programming, gaming, video editing) this wasn't a big deal, but if you care about things like watching movies/TV or editing photos or doing digital drawing, that could be a concern. Overall, good value."
3.0,"Okay, but not great.",For the price it could be better.  The laptop has all good hardware the date I purchased it.  The graphics card ad processor are as good as some of the more expensive laptops.  As soon as I purchased my I upgraded the ram to 12 gigs.
4.0,Good Laptop for collage students..,"Bought it for my son who is studying in collage.....He will be using this Laptop mainly for 3D CAD software, MATLAB and Analysis tools. He installed few of these software and he is happy with the performance and the screen quality..."
