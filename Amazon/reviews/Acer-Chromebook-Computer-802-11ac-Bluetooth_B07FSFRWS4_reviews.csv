5.0,Greatest budget friendly laptop there is,"I'm unsure why there's bad reviews, but I wouldn't listen to them. I actually decided on this computer while at Best Buy where I was able to look and touch the computer before purchasing. I've been using Microsoft/HP my ENTIRE life. I was extremely unsure about a chromebook. I went back and forth with myself for weeks. But let me say this, if you're an android lover, this chromebook will come as a second nature. It's based off the Google play store, and some of the features are great! (Like, if you have your phone unlocked nearby, you do not have to input a password to your computer.) Biggest selling points was the screen size. Most of the chromebooks I found are much smaller and this has a HUGE screen with such beautiful quality. The display settings also offer a night light/blue light filter which I absolutely LOVE about it! Battery life is great, fans are quiet, and just all around great computer. Speed is lightning fast, I actually expected less. I have nothing bad to say about this laptop. If you haven't bought it already, I'm not sure what you're waiting for."
5.0,Big Screen,"I love this Chromebook. The price was great, the screen is nice and large, battery life lasts a long time and it isn't heavy. This works great for school and fits all of my needs. I haven't come across a situation where I needed a PC or different system.  I'm very pleased with getting a 2018 model for under $200, especially with the screen size. The speakers are nicer than the last Chromebook model I had as well. I'm very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Very Very Nice,For 90 percent of the populous this will more than meet your demands. Extremely fast startup. More like instant. Picture quality is great. Operational speed very fast. Metal case. Automatically updates. Many apps available for it.  No viruses.
3.0,Upgrade from CB5-571-C1DZ,"Chromebook fanatic. Have several. This is an upgrade from 3 yr old 15"" Chromebook. Faster. Brilliant colors. Improved keyboard. For $200 you can't go wrong. REVISED to 3 stars. Downgraded for low screen resolution. While it is faster than my 2 yr old Chromebook with same size screen the resolution is 1366 x 768 vs 1920 x 1080 on the older computer."
5.0,Lightweight and very fast. What more could I ask for?,"Having used HP laptops for years, through various operating systems, I decided to try a Chromebook because I simply can't stand Windows 10. It's slow, ponderous, and takes forever to update. The price of this computer was a definite plus. It's quick and agile, and I'm very comfortable with the Android OS. It took fewer than 5 minutes to set up this computer, from the time I plugged it in until I turned it off. For the big stuff I still have my desktop computer (also Acer), but I can see myself using this laptop gem for a lot more tasks. I feel this was a wise decision and purchase."
5.0,Amazing great inexpensive Chromebook!,"Amazing great inexpensive Chromebook! I purchased this for my in-laws that are not at all techies to replace a dog slow old Dell  laptop, and they absolutely love it! I am very impressed with the quality of it and the performance for basic functions such as email, web surfing, YouTube videos etc. Setup was a breeze! ChromeOS found the local USB printer and got it working right away automatically. The build quality is solid for a basic 15.6 inch laptop. The battery life is great (12 hours). The screen quality is perfectly good as well. Nice snappy little laptop!"
5.0,Very Affordable!,I have had the computer for 3 months. It has been running very efficiently. What a great price!
4.0,Great inexpensive laptop computer BUT slow if you are used to fast typing on Mac,Previously had a Mac laptop computer and have the iPad and iMac needed a laptop to write while recovering from surgery.  Purchased this as a temporary fix.  It is really a nice computer and for the price would be great for college students.  If you are used to typing fast of the mac you'll find this different.  Most actions involve two key steps.  For an unknown reason when typing fast I find the cursor moves up and I have to stop and re position it.  Could be user error....
5.0,replacement for the 2015 model.,"Bought this for my 84 year old mother. I bought her one in 2015 she loved it. It got a lot of use by a lot of people. Im sure it just needs a new battery and the bottom battery port. The bottom is because a family member messed with it and cracked it not acer's issue. but, because it is a 2015 there are not a lot of parts for me to fix it and she really missed surfing the web.. which is what chromebooks are great for! The battery life lasted 4 days before she had to recharge. She wasn't on it a lot this week. But the battery is a lot longer lasting than the 2015. it is wonderful for her to do what she does, goes on facebook, pay bills, and clicks on stuff that would give a normal laptop a virus! but, since Chromebooks run everything through a sandbox , they don't get viruses. I have the c720 from 5 years ago and im using it to put up this review. they update regularly and quickly by time you restart it has updated. Everything you used to do on Windows , Chrome has  google docs and other programs for that. i do not miss windows one bit.  Great machine at a great price! love Acer's Google Chromebooks."
5.0,So far so good.,Screen is big.Everything works.
2.0,Don't Cheap Out,"At first it seems like a great laptop for the price. After about a week the computer started to slow down drastically. The OS is interesting to use and a lot of simple tasks become complicated because of the limitations of the OS. The computer runs alright when only one tab is open but once multiple tabs are opened the computer runs real slow and pages load super slow. I bought this because I fried my MacBook and needed a quick cheap replacement while I worked on getting my MacBook repaired. I used the computer for about two weeks until I got fed up and just bought a new MacBook. I would not recommend this laptop for anyone unless all you plan on doing is watching youtube videos (even youtube loads/runs slow) and maybe checking emails. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone who is looking to use it for work as it runs slow and reduces productivity significantly. Battery life is no good either, a full charge lasts a couple hours just simply browsing the web. The only nice thing about the laptop is how it syncs with everything Google, but then again, any laptop can do that nowadays. Don't waste your money trying to buy a cheap computer like this; do some research and get something with a legitimate OS."
5.0,WHAT REFURB? PERFECTION..LOOKS BRAND NEW! : ),UPDATE: LIGHTNING SP33D + MOUSE IS NEEDED!
1.0,Dont bother,"Computer was so slow, kept shutting down, and had to return it.  Terrible investment for college."
5.0,Chromebook,"I bought this chromebook under the advice of my 16 year old grandson because I dont have the knowledge about computers like he does and he was right! I love my new chromebook! I like the wider screen like this one has, the brightness, etc.. I don't need or want anything fancy, just wanted a simple computer that I can learn and move around on. We did a lot of comparisons on them. I highly recommend this one because it is what I needed and the back stays up too! I like the company I bought it from and would buy from them again."
5.0,Great starter laptop,"Easy to set up, screen quality is good. This is great for a beginner. Audio sounds clear."
3.0,Great for using Office 365,"This is a low end, kinda underpowered machine. That's not a complaint, just the fact. I'm finding it useful for Office 365 in Chrome - don't bother with the Office apps. I also have the Fortinet VPN client to access the company VPN. And I found a good RDP client to connect to computers in the office. All in all, a good machine for the money for what I'm doing with it. And it's Android, so there isn't the maintenance overhead of a Windows machine. Buy em for your road warriors."
4.0,decent chromebook,This chromebook is decent at most. And definitely useable.
1.0,Chrome OS is garbage and I can't even use Turbo tax.  Terrible touch pad,"I bought a Chrome book because every 2 minutes my old computer had a pushy pop up sales advertisement saying it ""suggest"" I use Chrome because it was faster.  So sorry now.  I can't even do my taxes on it because Turbo Tax doesn't work on it!!  It is so different from Windows you have to relearn about clicking on different file extensions to open various files.  Are you serious? The scroll bar is so narrow, even on a 15 inch screen, I can rarely click on it the first or second time.  To ""right click"" on the touchpad  I have to hammer it down with my finger.  I can't even use this."
1.0,Budget laptop? More like busted laptop.,"This advertised fast speed internet and ease of use, neither of those were true. Once I had more than two tabs open the computer it was slower than a granny taking a Sunday drive. Save your money get a decent laptop. This was just one disappointment after another. I really wanted to love it too."
5.0,Best Value for the Money,I searched laptops by ratings and came across this one...I wasn't looking to break the bank.  I received this laptop in 2 days...and was able to set it up in minutes (which is quite a feat as I am technically challenged)  - I've had 5-6 windows opened at a time and it runs fast and easy....I can't believe what a great laptop I got for the money!
3.0,Good cheap personal laptop,It's a bit slow in terms of performance but it worked out great for limited use cases and patient users.
5.0,Chromebook is easier then a windows pc,I love everything on. It very easy computer to use very good screen and sound
5.0,A Great Chromebook,"This is a great chromebook. This is my first time to purchase a chromebook. I only use it to go online. For this price, it is perfect, no complaints."
4.0,Very nice Chromebook,"I like the look of it and it works great. I hate the fact that it does not have the key pad to the right of the keyboard like my Dell laptop.  I also don't like that it has no CD drive but I knew that when I bought it. Good price and a good product but would not buy another one, just my preference, as I like the laptop with the CH/DVD and the numeric key pad better than this Chromebook."
5.0,Five Stars,Really good so far.
5.0,My first chromebook and I am impressed.,Only complaint is that the screen quality is poor in my opinion.  Connected it to an external monitor and it is perfect.  For the price it is darn good.
4.0,Works great,This was a birthday gift for my 16 year old son. He loves it and uses it daily for homework and entertainment. Its an awesome piece for the price.
3.0,"Slow compared to my old Chromebook, loud trackpad","I purchased this to upgrade from an old HP Chromebook I've used for years due to some dead pixels on the HP screen. This Acer is noticeably slower despite having twice the RAM, particularly wit h the new Gmail. In addition, the keyboard is lower quality and the mousepad is extremely loud.  To top it off, this one actually cost more than my old one. Was tempted to return it, but kept it as a backup. Still looking for a replacement for my old one."
5.0,Fast and cheap,"I just use my home computer for entertainment purposes only.  Internet, mostly and storing Albums.  If that's all you need just get this one and save $$."
5.0,"Only had a short time, but Great so far","Great so far, but I only used it a short time. We'll see how well it helps up!"
1.0,Worst piece of junk I have ever owned,"This computer is cheap; I knew that going in but I was hoping that it would have basic functioning for writing. All I was looking for is a device that I could use to go to the coffee shop or library and write. This machine can't even handle that task. Not to mention, the resolution is horrible. It is unbelievably disfunctional. I will be returning this thing as soon as possible."
5.0,An amazing laptop for students,"I am a nursing student, and my old laptop (a Lenovo yoga) finally died on me after so many years. I needed an upgraded laptop for starting the nursing program. I did lots of research on various laptops that are great for students and I could not have chosen a better laptop. Although the laptop takes a few weeks to get used to, the keyboard set up is a bit different (nothing that causes any difficulty typing) and the screen is fairly large. The large screen works in my favor. I have the ability to split the screen between two windows, so I can simultaneously write my papers while referencing the article all in one. The memory on this laptop is amazing, and allows me to save my files in any form (pdf,word,open document,etc) making submissions for various classes easy. The fact that this is a google computer is one of the main reasons i love it so much. I have everything I need readily available and Google makes this a laptop that is super easy to navigate. 10/10 would recommend to any student. I'm not sure about gaming capabilities or anything outside of my academic needs, but I can't imagine that there is anything this laptop can do well."
5.0,Great for students & online use,"I bought two of these for my high school and junior high students and two months later they have been flawless and used extensively. They easily access cloud drives, write and submit papers for school in both Google Docs and Office 365 (running in browser) and take them to school in their backpacks on occasion. I even managed to get them to print to my WiFi network printer. I expected to have to help them often with technical hurdles but have not had a single  If WiFi is not readily available, you won't want this (or any Chromebook). But if it is and you aren't looking to install Windows apps, this is worth every penny and then some. I bought the extended warranty, because kids. Even with that cost tacked on, it is still well worth the price."
1.0,Flimsy power connection,"The power connection is the most flimsy I've ever seen, and keeps coming out. It's tiny, and it's loose even when its in there. What a corner to cut!"
2.0,VERY Poor screen resolution,"I got this as an extra computer to use at work (light use-checking emails, etc) . I like that the screen is large. It is quite heavy, which I don't really mind. It gets kind of glitchy at times, especially when more than one web page is open at the same time (I don't even mind that) . Battery life is amazing. The reason for the 2 stars is the screen resolution. The very first smartphones that came out had better resolution than this screen. I realize you'll get less screen resolution because of the price of this laptop, but this was horrible. Makes it very hard to see without squinting and adjusting the screen all the time, which also doesn't help much."
4.0,So far so good,I bought this for my husband.  At the time I didn't realize it was re-furbished.  I think the price I paid for this was as much as a brand new PC.  I only realized it was re-furbished after I looked at the receipt.  I bought it as a gift for father's day.
1.0,CPU and Memory Usage Maxed even when nothing running,I haven't purchased a new PC in a decade or more and this is the worst PC i've ever purchased. A PC built in 2018 should be able to play youtube videos without lag.
5.0,Great value laptop,"Our desktop computer crashed so looked for something portable and great value.  Very easy to complete setup and start web surfing. We do not use for gaming, but for banking and some web surfing. Great battery life and fast proceesor."
5.0,A Quantum Leap?,This laptop will hopefully bring me into the 21st century with its ever-evolving computer technology. For years I've lagged behind the rest of the world with unreliable internet connections and other problems. As my 2nd device Chromebook seems to have fixed that. My old notebook now snaps to attention when I tell it to connect. Maybe it's just afraid of losing its job! In any case I'm happy with the purchase.
5.0,Perfect for what i got it for,I got it for internet browsing and internet browsing alone. Battery life is great. Screen size is great. Price is great.
5.0,Works Right Out of the Box,Gave to Grand kids for Christmas and they were playing on them in 15 minutes. They love this little unit and I can't believe the price for the quality!
5.0,Affordable Laptop Ready to Go Out of Box,"Great, lightweight laptop, at a very affordable price.  Came ready to go out of the box.  Just had to charge it a little but it fired up in about 3 seconds.  After about 2 mins setting up my info for Gmail, it was ready to go.  All my settings transferred over.  All my Chrome bookmarks did as well.  Screen quality is very good.  Sound is good as well.  Keyboard types quietly.  So far, it's exactly what the advertisement says it is.  Perfect for anyone that just needs to surf the internet, or work on Google Docs/Gmail related items.  Great for the price. Very fast!"
3.0,Ger what you don't pay for,I wish I'd know how less than crystal clear the screen was before buying. I've accepted it now but it's definitely subpar especially for the price.
5.0,Quality,"I have two of these laptops (one older) but this one was to replace a very old chromebook that finally gave up on him. I have a Windows laptop too but these are faster. If you're not used to working with apps and researching what you can do on a chromebook, you'll have a learning curve. The only issue I've had is some apps aren't all they say they are (Microsoft Word) but I've had my Windows 10 crash plenty too."
2.0,sound quality?!?,"So I literally just got this today, love everything about it except when I opened a youtube video. the sound quality SUCKS~~~~~~~~~~!!!! and the volume height is SOOOooo loooowwWW. ughhhh I need to send this back now and get a less cheepbook with better quality sound this will not do, videos is basically all I use this for. . . my lame old cheap cell phone sound quality sounds way better than this. Boo!"
5.0,Dont Hesitate. Great Buy,Affordable and easy to use. Love it
3.0,Not what I expected,"I like the storage, and the screen quality."
3.0,"Great buy but slow & choppy, Celeron processor to avoid","love Acer Chromebooks, but some are too slow, choppy, pause while you're typing, etc. very frustrating"
5.0,Very Good Purchase for the price,"When I started looking for a new Laptop, I wanted something different from my Dell. I was just about done with all the glitches with Windows. I came across this model and I have to say I am more than satisfied with it. The set up took minutes and very easy. The battery life is strong, and my apps for TV and gaming are working smoothly. Great for all your usual email and doc's. I am happy I chose this product."
5.0,Easy to use and fast computer,"This has basically replaced my work laptop. I open this and it's ready to roll where my work laptop takes anywhere from 1-3 minutes to get going--Windoze.  There are very few things that I cannot accomplish on this Chromebook, and I have found some work arounds or solutions to most of my challenges.  Easy to set up and use, I'd  recommend this to anyone who is tired of waiting for their computer to update all the time."
5.0,Easy to use. I really like this chromebook!,I didn't like moving the cursor around with my fingers. That is why I bought myself a wireless mouse. It is easier for me since I am older and used to a mouse. Otherwise I love it.  Wanted to use it for ancestry.com. So much better to have a larger screen (15.6) than a small one that I was using on my Kindle.
5.0,Great,Made the switch from Windows to chromebook and am happy with it.
5.0,way better than a notebook for my use.,chrome books are way faster than notebooks and more reliable for most of what i use them for. this is the second chromebook i have owned both acer and i have not been dissapointed in either of them.
1.0,save your money and buy something decent,"Its slow, colors contrast is terrible and if you click on a story and in it is a sidebar, click on that and its impossible to read as the scroll feature is uncontrollable and the drop down ads take forever to download.  in some situations the scrol down feature disappears entirely."
4.0,Excellent Chromebook,"This is the second Chromebook I've had and I love it. I mostly surf websites, pay bills, email, text, and use Google Drive/photos. I don't use it for gaming. The screensize and weight is perfect if you need to carry it somewhere or just use at home."
5.0,"To me, it's quality for the money",This product has quality for the money.
1.0,Acer doesnt care about consumers,"As i said, pretty much bought from every vendor and so far msi and dell r the ones that have helped even when a few days out of warranty. cant say the same about acer. they forgot to install something on the laptop n i just went ahead n bought it after they denied helping me with the parts that were suppose to b in the laptop in the first place. surely will b my last acer product."
5.0,Great Product,"Love it, so happy with my purchase.  I have a smaller Chrome Book I bought a few years ago thru Amazon and it still works great too.  Just wanted something bigger, so very easy to use because of already being established with my previous chrome book."
1.0,Great.... However....,"How unfortunate. Did not suit my needs at all. I purchased this Chromebook to use primarily for remote desktop software. I didn't have audio when working in music production applications. I have never had that issue before with other Chromebooks. I couldn't even get sound in Google Play Music remotely (just did that to test the machine), or any other mp3 player for that matter. The Chromebook also kept restarting and was sluggish. I had high hopes, but Acer is now on my ""do not buy"" list."
1.0,Screen resolution is very poor & fuzzy,"I was extremely disappointed and surprised to see and realize that the screen resolution is only 1366x768 and not 1920x1080 like my much older version of the same model CB5.  You can see pixels and jagged edges, which makes even reading text very annoying."
4.0,Even a luddite can set it up!,I am not computer savvy at all. I got this computer all set up within 5 minutes (probably less).
3.0,Get what you pay for. Functional but quirky.,It’s perfect for web based applications. I use a lot of google docs so it’s perfectly functional. Only problem is it occasionally (1-3 times a day during an 8 hour work day) shuts off on its own and then turns back on. I contacted amazon and heard nothing back. I guess that’s what you get for a $200 device.
5.0,Great computer,Great value computer
5.0,Big,"I only kept it a short time, but only because it's size. It was too big for my taste, but a good size for husband."
5.0,Good buy,Worth $217 bucks for sure.  Screen is not as crisp as I would like but it’s quick & gets what I need done.
5.0,This machine runs Aps not programs,"I purchased unit to replace broken laptop. It  does the basics and connects to the internet very well. Great for the normal user. Very nice price. The only problem is that is not able run technical specific software, beats win10 hands down."
4.0,Good price:value ratio,"For the price, it’s pretty good. Certainly a value oriented laptop, but if all you are doing is google docs like stuff online, it’s great. Games and general sluggishness, but for a price you won’t even notice, it’s a great deal"
5.0,Excellent- Great Price,Excellent laptop for basic needs  Excellent price and beautifully large screen.
5.0,very fast,Paid $10 more than the original Acer  Chromebook I bought years ago.  10 times better.
1.0,Slow as Molasses!,This notebook is sooooo slow to load web pages -- it is virtually worthless!  What a waste of money.  I do not understand all the positive reviews.  Shame on amazon for recommending it!!! Junk...
5.0,Worth it,Good laptop  it is lightweight
5.0,Kids loved them.,This was the deal for the money I could find for chrome books for our kids. They live the large screen. Only drawback with chrome books is they are almost impossible to protect from inappropriate sites for kids.
5.0,works great,Have had it about a week and love it.  Simple to set up and am enjoying the larger screen.  I am rough on things so bought a key pad protector and a pearl cover.  Like all of them
5.0,Great laptop chrome book.,"This is a great chrome book, I love the fact it is portable."
3.0,"Good, Not Great","We purchased this for my daughter so she could write. It works perfectly fine. However, It does feel like cheap plastic. And the mouse you have to hit hard for it to realize you are trying to double click on it. That being said, you can't beat the price."
5.0,Wonderful product,Bought this computer with the hope it would be faster and easy to use.  This product provides everything I wanted in a computer...  Definitley would recommend this product............
5.0,Love,Love it
4.0,The best budget laptop,I LOVE this computer. It's so fast and does exactly what I need and the screen is huge. Not the BEST quality screen or sound but for $200 I am so in love. Way better than my HP Inspiron I bought. A few years ago for more money. There's no freezing or lagging.
1.0,"Useless, product should be taken off the market.","Turn it on and it shuts off immediately, and repeatedly. Unable to use and after some research I found this seems to be a common problem."

2.0,Acer Chromebook,I am a little older so it is very hard to see the keyboard letter.  It needs larger more visible letters.
5.0,Great value for a student laptop,"So far so good!  I bought 2 of these chrome books for my teenage daughters for Christmas and they are a huge hit. If they hold up and perform thus well for the next ~18 months, they will be well worth the low price."
