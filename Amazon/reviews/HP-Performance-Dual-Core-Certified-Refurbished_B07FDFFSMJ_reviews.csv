5.0,Like New! Awesome laptop for the price !,"Awesome!!! Works wonderfully. That being said I did not download Microsoft office . Only very small programs like google chrome and team viewer. I use this to connect to the remote server of my company in Los Angeles and to browse the internet , online shopping etc. runs fast. Not at all slow . I was hesitant to bug because of the reviews but I have to say I am very happy with my purchase!"
1.0,Bad product,"Within a week of receiving the package, it  started being unstable and blinking off. I have just had the laptop for only a week and this is the worst purchase I have made ever. It has discouraged me from purchasing electronics online."
2.0,OK  Just OK,This is likely a good value for the money. I took a few stars off because although the storage is obviously low it leaves no room for anything to be added. Included apps and items that cannot be removed consume all the delivered space.  I was unable to add Microsoft office. Wow. It also has frozen up several times in my first use
1.0,DO NOT BUY !,"You get what you pay for. The laptop was delivered with out an SSD card and  would not turn on. Won’t be buying anything from this seller ever again. I had to order a replacement, if they don’t get that right. I’m returning this cheap laptop."
1.0,Purchasing this was a huge mistake.,Laptop was delivered without a power cord and with a dead battery.  Happened to have an HP power cord on hand so was able to start laptop.  Once it started it showed the battery was not charging.  Ran diagnostics and it showed the battery itself was bad and had to be replaced.  I will be returning it as soon as possible.
5.0,Great Deal,I waited awhile to write this review to make sure everything checked out. I would Highly recommend this computer. It is a great computer for on the go. It came with the charger cord and a good battery. I take it everywhere no problems. It is not a gaming computer they cost 1600.00. It is a great web surfing email checking computer for a great price.
2.0,it is too slow to run even very basic programs like internet explorer,"I know it is the cheapest one I can find. However, it is too slow to run even very basic programs like internet explorer. Don't expect too much."
1.0,Awful memory,"The memory is absolute garbage and its already running slow. I have 5 things installed, fallout 1 and 2, steam, terraria discord and 7zip. I cant use any if these without this laptop screaming about space which is almost entirely used up by dumb windows apps i can't uninstall. I would save up the extra money used for this and just buy something better"
2.0,Not very Impressed,"With a new computer, this thing has been having issues from the start. It runs quite slow, and the quality on the screen is decent but it isn't capable of doing much other than simple needs. You get what you pay for."
1.0,You get what you pay for,You get what you pay for. Sent back.
5.0,it is fine,"my home internet is SLOW so this is slow, but it is fie for internet searches and social media."
1.0,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY DOES NOT WORK,"I would not waste my money on this again. Piece of s**t, runs super slow and not worth the 200$ I spent."
1.0,"They sent me a glitchy piece of junk that crashes it first twenty minutes, buyer beware","I am furious, I have had this thing open twenty minutes and I can what a piece of junk it is, it's slow l, explorer is crashing, I am going to write a full review once I contact amazon for a return and a functional product to be sent..... This is ridiculous"
1.0,"Low price is a false flag, look elsewhere",Extremely low quality and does not function properly. Not worth your money.
5.0,Start up quick,It's fast light and good quality machine for the price I paid I'm satisfied
1.0,"Slow, poorly refurbished.  Don’t buy",I am super disappointed.  This computer is so slow and frequently crashes.  What a waste of my money
1.0,Waste.,This laptop was not what they advertised at all. Lowstorage space can barely even diwnload anything and its not black its a light blue and a waste of money
1.0,Broken,The computer was working when I got it and set it up or so I thought. The next day I turned on the laptop and the screen was black. I’m very disappointed I bought this laptop because my old one broke and I needed it for school.
1.0,No storage,Don’t buy. As soon as it got WiFi it went to up day and could not because it had no room. Brand new
5.0,Buy,Brought it for my girlfriend she loves it
