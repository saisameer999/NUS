4.0,I Like It!!!,"I received this computer this past Friday.  In the past, seems like I spent the first couple of days just updating Windows.  I was never able to do much work or just enjoy the capabilities of a new laptop.  Imagine my surprise when I started this one up and Cortana walked me through the set up (prior computer was a Lenovo (Thinkpad or Ideapad) Windows computer that had been upgraded to Win10 several years ago).  This was a much more pleasant experience.  I have been reluctant to use any type of voice actuated anything (guess I am a dinosaur).  Set up was a breeze.  I spent a couple hours Saturday updating the Dell system drivers, etc. nothing extensive and have been enjoying this new laptop considerably."
1.0,"Can't use this ""new"" machine","I purchased this 8/2 for my son's 13th birthday, which is today. He opened the laptop, very excited to set it up. Well....it is registered to another gmail account and we cannot get into the computer to use it. I guess maybe it was purchased and returned?? It is completely unusable to us without the pin and password from the previous owner. Also, this was purchased as a NEW item."
5.0,Great laptop using windows 10!,Not a bad laptop.
1.0,Dell is a dud,"I bought a Dell computer several years ago and had a bad experience with them in terms of support but thought I would give them another chance with is purchase. The price was reasonable and the specs were more than what I expected for the price. When I got it, I tried to load a basic bible program and it would not recognize the program and was super, super slow. I took it to Geek squad and they supposedly checked it out and loaded that program that I couldn't and told me it was ok. I got it home and it is still super slow to boot up. I tried to purchase 365 from Microsoft and every time I tried to buy the download, it stops nd says that there is a problem with the PC and restarts automatically. I tried the purchase 4 times and each time it did the same thing. I am junking this Dell and going back to HP. Should never have left them. Never had a problem with their PC's. Dell is a dud."
1.0,Beware,"I purchased this computer 14 days ago, brand new. After day 10 I started having issues the start menu would not come up I could not access the start menu at all. So I called Dell they walked me thru the steps of trouble shooting it. After I completed the troubleshoot the computer restrated & never booted back up. It would should show the Dell screen then go black with loading symbol. Dell said I had a Warranty & could send it to them to be fixed but it’s not guaranteed that it can be fixed. I was sold a defected computer but I’m happy that it happened this quickly because I returned it today & is waiting on my refund. My next purchase I will do a lot more research."
1.0,Too slow,Bought it as a gift for my brother but I don’t think he will have patience to use this. It’s too slow and makes weird cracking noise. The moment i turn it on the fan makes a loud noise. I
4.0,good price,"laptop very functional and effective in terms of capacity, excellent design and quality, to use daily in a day of study or work."
5.0,"Good price, easy set up and works great","Good price , easy set up and works great."
5.0,Great Laptop,Great Laptop. Very fast. And very good deal. Works great. Handles multiple tasks really well.
1.0,"Slow, very slow",Incredibly slow. Like a laptop from the 90’s. I installed 4gb extra ram which didn’t do much. Runs at close to 100% cpu with 2 browser windows open. Going to have to sell to someone who doesn’t need speed and repurchase something else
1.0,One Star,Package arrived on time in excellent condition. The computer however is shockingly slow. Basically unusable.
5.0,seems to be pretty decent.,seems to be pretty decent ..got it for my 80 year old mom so I put classic shell (like win 7) on it as she would have a rough time learning win 10 lol. The laptop starts up a little slow but once it finishes booting it seems to work pretty good she seems to be happy with it and i dont hear her complaining like with her old one lol...her old one was getting really old..it still had win 7 from when win 7 was new.
1.0,"Terribly slow, odd track pad (no buttons on track pad)","Extremely slow, after two weeks of owning it I am still experiencing 12 minute boot up times. I have contacted Dell who reviewed my computer remotely and told me everything is working fine. When I click to access the start menu and attempt to shut down, it often takes over a minute for the screen to come up. I have tried installing programs (Dell's own remote access program) and have been unsuccessful, the screen will go blank and take several minutes to restart. Sadly, in my haste I threw out the box once I had opened it so I can no longer return it."
1.0,SLOWER THAN A SLOTH,"Cannot even imagine why anyone would rate this above a 1.  If there were a negative star, I would pick it.  Its slow and continually freezes, and that's only trying to access a site through Chrome, nothing complicated.  My friend purchased it and missed the opportunity to return it due to health issues.  I'm writing this on his behalf because he can't and we will likely have to buy him another and toss this one."
1.0,One Star,It works very slowly and freezes and lasts a long time
5.0,Great Dell Laptop,"I have been pleasantly amazed at the quality of this laptop, especially for the price I paid.  I did take the liberty of replacing Windows 10 with a Linux OS, since I am not a Windows fan, but overall, this Dell has surpassed all of my expectations.  How it holds up in the long haul remains to be seen, since I've only had it three weeks, but if it keeps up as is did out of the box, I will continue to be happy with it, hopefully for a very long time."
4.0,"Good, decent computer at a good price","It seems this is getting reviews from other models as well, so I'll be clear.  This is a brand new, 15 inch laptop computer, not refurbished.  This is a decent, basic computer.  Many reviews are calling it slow.  The first startup is a bit slow, as its in setup mode and you have to get your profile and all that worked out, so it did take a while to boot up.  Every subsequent time I have opened it up, it boots very quick.  Once I had it started up, I was pleased.  There is very little bloatware (unnecessary programs installed), and everything works well and fairly quick.  It's not slow, but not fast by any means.  I had no trouble running the internet along with another program or two.  If you want it to be faster, the RAM can be upgraded to 8 GB which should do the trick (it comes with 4, but has room to upgrade it).  The picture is nice, and everything works well."
1.0,Buyer Beware,This computer was beyond slow and didn't work for me at all so I returned it. Not sure if I just got a defective one but I would not recommend this to anyone.
4.0,So far so good!,"I just received my laptop today and I'm pleasantly surprised that it does not seem laggy at all despite being a very low-cost model. I agree with some of the other reviewers who mentioned the screen in their reviews. I don't have an issue with the brightness, however, I have noticed that it seems almost as though there's a barely noticeable fog over the screen. It's not truly bothersome regardless. I am impressed with the speaker sound. It is much better than I anticipated for the price.  After just a few hours of use, I'd recommend it."
3.0,Cheap for a Reason,Over the last decade I have owned about a dozen notebooks and laptops.  I often purchased them used and then upgraded them with more RAM or improved hard drives.
5.0,Dell laptop,Had a problem right out of the box. Video card is bad.
5.0,It came earlier than expected and was in perfect condition. It runs great and has a lot ...,I ordered this laptop for mostly school and to play Sims 3. I was skeptical about ordering a laptop online and having it delivered. I started thinking about all the things that could go wrong so I got next day delivery. It came earlier than expected and was in perfect condition. It runs great and has a lot of space. The sims 3 runs pretty good on low/medium settings. Overall its the best laptop I've had in years.
5.0,Great Dell for the price,"This is my 3rd Dell, and I think its great for the price, with 1 yr Dell warranty. I ordered this Dell because my old one died after 7 years of use and it was going to cost me more to fix than buy this one, which is almost the same model."
1.0,Very slow having problems with loading and running programs but a different type,I’ve been having a lot of problems with this it’s very slow turning on and it’s not having a hard time running my excel I only use this to do payroll of 18 people and email the excel file to payroll company I don’t use it for anything else I don’t scroll internet I don’t play games or watch movies when I bought this it was inexpensive and I thought no more then I was going to use it it would be a perfect laptop at this point It takes me forever to get payroll done it use to take about 30 minutes now since I started using this laptop it’s taking over an hour and half I’ve tried to reset reinstall ever I’ve bern told to do to speed it u but nothing has worked I wouldn’t suggest to purchase this laptop I like dell but maybe it’s just my laptop or maybe it’s all of them but I wouldn’t purchase again
1.0,Cannot get support,"I purchased this laptop 3 months ago.  The power supply got damaged and all I want to do is purchase a new power supply for it.. I called Dell who says the item is not supported because it was manufactured in the United Arab Emirates.  When I purchased it I thought it came with a warranty, but the warranty is not worth it if no one will support it.  But I don't even care about that, the laptop works.. all I need is a new power supply..  but neither Amazon Prime nor Dell is willing to help me.  Dell only offers for me to send it back for a full refund.  When all I need is a new damned power supply.. I am even willing to pay for it.. I want to order 2 power supplies so I have an extra just in case.. Really wish I could get some actual good customer service instead of nothing but run around.."
1.0,Very Disappointing Performance,"Once I received the laptop, I was hoping to upload some basic programs like MS Office, but I found the laptop was very slow and did not allow me to load the MS Office product.  I called Dell Tech Support and they went onto my computer to check out the system.  There Windows 10 program and the DVD system was very out of date.  After 90 minutes of them working on the new laptop, the Dell Tech Support representative suggested that I return the laptop since the programs were very out of date.  I was expecting that this laptop would be ready to use right out of the box and it was far from that."
3.0,No Power Cord & Runs Kinda Slow,"This is a decent laptop, but seems to run kind of slow from what I'm used to. My work laptop is a Dell and I thought this was a similar laptop, but you can tell how much slower this one runs compared to my work laptop. However, for the price it is a good laptop for personal use. The one complaint I mainly have is it didn't come with a power cord and was dead when I received it and couldn't turn it on to see if it even worked. I ordered the power cord separately, got it charged, and everything seemed to work okay."
1.0,Buy any other laptop,"Really disappointed with this computer, it’s slow and freezes constantly.  Even when running just a couple basic programs (eg, Word and excel) it freezes constantly.  This is my second, and last, Dell."
5.0,Good computer,"I was able to set up everything just fine on my new laptop. It doesn't seem to run slow or anything, and I'm happy with it. I was a bit worried about the packing. The computer box was in a slightly larger box, but not padded at all, and the computer box was banging around inside the other one, but it doesn't seem to have damaged it at all, so I guess it was okay."
3.0,Seems really slow and I don't have a lot of faith in it,"It's toobad this is so slow I really needed it to use with quick books. It doesn't seem like it's coming on but it really is.  I did do some research so it should run my quick books and I really haven't given it much of a workout because it's a little bit tiresome to have to set up a new computer, Especially one that wants me to have  special accounts."
1.0,beware,"I bought this for my mom and because it had a Dell sticker on it. She is retired and on a fixed income. When I saw the price I was sceptical but it is a Dell so how bad can it be? Well it is absolutely the slowest new laptop I've ever used. I'm putting in an SSD to try and make it useable. It runs Windows 10, it runs her programs, it functions in every way like a good laptop, it  just  takes  forever  to  do  anything.  Save up and get a laptop with better components. Or buy this one if you're working on making your inner self more patient."
1.0,Turtle 🐢 Slowest Computer Ever,"Probably the slowest computer I have ever used in my life. DO NOT BUY! I promise you, you will not be happy if you are expecting a modern computer. The computer takes 5 minutes to load at start and take 1 - 3 minutes per opening of any application or program. The only good thing about this computer is the battery life. If you dont mind waiting have at it."
5.0,Great laptop!,Love this computer! The price was great as well! 💕 been using it every day for the last 6 months are so.
1.0,So slooooow,"I purchased this laptop because my old one was painfully slow.  This one is just as bad.  We've fixed the code problem that Dell knows about but doesn't address, and that worked for a while.  Now, it takes two or three minutes (sometimes longer) just to connect to the internet, you sit and wait for it to load webpages or open programs, and it's even slow at wordprocessing.  Really sloooow."
1.0,Del support sucks,This computer stopped working.It wouldn't accept the password until I put the numbers in on the number pad then I wouldn't let me enter anything with the keyboard. It was a pain. When I called Del support for assistance with the password they told me I had to buy a special disc for $110. Thanks for nothing.
4.0,Works well for basic computer needs,"I didn't need anything special. I look at facebook, and shop online. Ot works well for that. The keys on the keyboard are not like my old HP laptop. Those seemed more sturdy than this new one. I am happy with it."
4.0,Damaged Box,"The laptop works perfectly, but I wish it was packaged better. The box it was sent in was an absolute mess. It was beaten up badly. I was concerned that it wouldn't work at the start, but it worked just fine. My only concern about this was the item being safe on the road considering how fragile laptops are. Overall, it's a good budget laptop that works well enough for school and work. If you need a laptop just for those purposes then, it does the job splendidly."
2.0,Way slower than the 5 year old laptop it replaced!,This laptop is so slow that it reminds me of using dial-up internet. Don't ever try to watch a video on this. You'll be old and grey before the end!
1.0,It looks like a used one,"It looks like a used one. I am really disappointed. Everything is good with the look and the frame. But the work process is really bad. It has a red spot on the screen, i think one of the pixels doesnt work. And while i am using it, the processor malfunctions and makes beeps."
1.0,THIS IS THE CRAPPIEST COMPUTER I HAVE EVER USED,I BOUGHT THIS COMPUTER OVER A YEAR AGO BUT I DID NOT USE IT UNTIL ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO.  IT IS AWFUL I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH IT- I THINK IT WAS FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY BECAUSE I HAVE TO CHANGE THE SETTINGS OR THE KEYS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SAY THEY ARE. BESIDES THAT THE COMPUTER HAS MALFUNCTIONED MULTIPLE TIMES AND DELL IS LITTLE TO NO HELP- I CONSTANTLY GO BACK TO MY OLD ASUS COMPUTER.  MY OPINION  THIS IS A LEMON MY MOM HAD A DELL AND IT WAS ALSO A LEMON NOT USER FRIENDLY AND THE SOUND ON IT IS THE WORST I HAVE HEARD.
2.0,Damn Near Only Good for a Paperweight,"Seemed decent so I got it for a work/browsing machine.  A basic machine is all I wanted, but the lack of RAM/Processing speed is the worst thing about it- just opening a web browser can push you into 30-40%.  God forbid you have multiple tabs open.  Number Lock has no indicator- a personal pet peeve."
1.0,piece of junk,"I bought this item in Jan. and after 2 months I am very sorry.  it is slow and locks up all the time, it seems to getting worse.  I have tried to contact Dell but i have gotten no response.  i really dont recommend getting this computer.  and use to be a big fan of Dell."
5.0,Dell Laptop,I did a previous review stating that you need to reinstall Windows. It is also very important to defragment the hard drive . I used a defragmenter I downloaded and my computer was slow. Then I used the one that comes with Windows and it speeded up tremendously. It may take 1 1/2 hours to do it the first time but its worth it. If you want to keep the Dell software try this also. It will help a great deal.
1.0,Worked for 2 weeks,"I purchased this laptop in November as a gift for my 86 year old mother.  She got it, loved it!  Then two weeks after she received it the laptop stopped working.  It went to a blank screen when she logged in and would go no further.  Unfortunately, I live out of town and she kept forgetting to tell me about the problem.  I visited her the second week of Feb. and she pointed out the problem.  I still have not been able to figure out the problem, but when looking online the Dells seem to have a chronic problem with this situation.  Unfortunately, since my mother kept forgetting  to tell me, we are not outside the window of being able to return the item.  Wasted money for sure!"
1.0,Too slow,"Don’t waste you money. Yes it’s cheap but that’s exactly the problem. It’s slow, cheap plastic and useless. If you can, add couple more hundred dollars and buy a much better computer. This model should be discontinued as it can’t support any modern software at this point."
4.0,Dell ordenador muy bien,"El ordenador está muy bien, rápido, tiene todo, CD, webcam wireless y Bluetooth hdmi SD card! Nada más llegar a ver películas todo el día! La única cosa es que pagué 5 euro más porque llegase en una semana y llego con retraso porque lo enviaron a un otro destino! Seguente VEZ no me gasto más lo 5 euro si llega como un qualquier otro envío!"
1.0,One Star,Did not work. Had to return to sender. Perhaps this one was defected
1.0,Programs,Worked for a week now it won't turn on
2.0,"Bought 18 computers, maybe 6 consistently work","I am simply using this computer for testing. I do not download anything, I have not downloaded additional programs. I simply use it for the internet only."
2.0,Too slow,I read older reviews and took a gamble on this Dell laptop. So far it's very slow and gets stuck loading pages. Even opening basic software like Word takes way too long.
1.0,Did not WORK,Had 100% cpu and disk usage after 3 days of trying everything I am returning
2.0,Poor Quality Sadly Disappointed,This pc moves slower than the one it replaced. The screen gets erratically fuzzy for no reason and it takes forever to boot up. Not even close to the quality I've been getting from other purchases and I'm stuck with a machine I'll have to replace soon.
1.0,Not actually worth the money,"I've had a laptop that I bought back in 2013 for similar price (unfortunately it broke), yet this one is significantly slower than my old laptop and makes insanely loud crackling and fan noises. The audio when playing videos also crackles often if you have several tabs open. I know the phrase ""you get what you pay for"", but this laptop seems to be way worse than what you pay for. There should be zero excuse for all the deficiencies that this laptop comes with such as being way slower and even more costly than a laptop I've bought 6 years ago at a cheaper price than this one."
4.0,Decent value for the money.,"Like everyone has said, definitely slow out of the box. I need to do a reinstall because just how slow it is, is driving me nuts. Otherwise it is an incredible bargain for the price and it does what I need it to do so I can’t complain."
1.0,6 months later it just randomly shuts off; not shuts down; just shuts off!?!,"I bought this as a donation to my small church, so we could record sermons and make available to members as needed.  Simple task; once a week usage.  Seems simple anyway, doesn't it?  Now in the 6th month, the PC just gives a quiet ""click"" and shuts off.  No it doesn't shutdown in some orderly fashion....it just shuts off!"
2.0,All products were satisfactory except the Computers,"The Dell Computer that I purchased is a refurbished laptop with Windovews 7 Program. The switch doesn't work properly and I have considerable difficulty getting it started. Also, it will not run the PHOTO printing program to reproduce my photos on my printer. I also bought a Dell with Windows- Windows 10 is a nightmare to run. I also tried to transfer my files from Windows 7 to my new Dell Windows 10 with no success. There you have it. I had previously bought two computers with windows 7; both would not function properly. I junked them."
5.0,Great value,"Slim, light and terrific screen resolution. Snappy processor and quick setup."
2.0,Dont bother!!!,Computer is slow takes 5-10 min to start up buy something better i regret buying it its only been a couple of months it was slow since the beginning but right now its way out of hand its fustrating to use !! Gets frozen takes so long to open any app!
2.0,Partially Disfuntional,"Looks good not as slow as other reviewer say it is, however, one problem I have is that the Esc, and the F Keys doesn't work. So I'm going to return it i Had doubts about buying this but i really wanted a Laptop computer.  look out for this serial number under the bottom 38157428918. if you purchase returned it."
4.0,Battery life is my only problem thus far,I bought this laptop for my daughter for her personal use and for use with her school work.
1.0,I DO NOT recommend this laptop!,This computer is awful! I ordered it once and returned it for a replacement as I thought I had just received a defective one. This one is just as bad. The first one was glitchy and slow however this one is just painfully SLOWWWWW!!!!! I didn't return it because I really needed it for upcoming meetings and there was no time to shop for a new one. It is so frustrating to work on. I regret not just returning it and shopping for a new on before I needed it so badly.
2.0,Lacks durability,"It's been less than one year since I've purchased the laptop, and it's remained in a laptop carry case. The screen no longer functions. It's very thin plastic all around and the durability of this is very very cheap. If you want something that will last, spend a bit more money."
1.0,DO NOT BUY,"This product is not worth your time or money. I have owned many Dell computers but this one is rated a piece of JUNK. It crashes all the time especially if you are using windows Edge, and freezes the computer so you have do a cold boot(power button) to restart the computer. Dell support, Dell non-support is the appropriate name doesn't even load. Trying to see if my Asurion insurance will take it back. What a let down from Amazon and Dell for selling this item."
1.0,Charger quit working but not before documents quit printing-less than 6 months after putchase,"Initially this laptop worked ok, except for a glitchy and extremely sensitive touchpad. I found settings that made the touchpad situation a little more tolerable. Documents were hesitant to print, had to try a couple of times. Charger was also ""iffy"". Today, just short of 6 months after purchase documents won't print even after reinstalling the printer and the charger will not connect. Need I say more?"
1.0,It's crap!,It doesn't work...can't get it to do all most anything...I've run diagnosis on it...still can't figure it out...I try to close a window and it wont...trying to shut it down..it wont...it's soooo slow...what can I do?
2.0,Slow...really slow,"Out of the box,.it's a very nice laptop. However once I opened up one program, Microsoft word, the CPU was already at 100 percent and lagging. Its difficult to do any tasks on this laptop as it cannot run any processes."
1.0,Don't buy this,Very slow I hate this laptop should have went through the reviews a little more I never would have bought it.
1.0,"If there were no stars or negative 10 stars, this is what i would give!","The computer never charges and does not keep a charge, came with the wrong power cord and has virus spamming in it! We have tried to remove my information from the computer in order to send it back and have been unable.. We feel the computer is some kind of info hacker or something strange being that the information wont erase!! No to mention hundreds of windows keep popping up in regards to the charger.."
1.0,One Star,Showed up in a crushed box and flickers.
4.0,It Works Great,"It's really a great brand (Dell) laptop for starters, if you're looking for affordability, the keys feels good when typing, the material that it is made from is great for gripping not like the others that are smooth. Screen size (15.6"") is prefect if you're looking for a good size.  Speed fairly good as well again for affordability, I can recommend this brand laptop to anyone."
5.0,Lap top,"Works great, love the CD rom, can watch a movie havent had to much trouble. Little bugs here and there I was able to fix so far"
5.0,"Great product, super fast shipping!!","Great laptop, great processor, flys through programs and webpages.. stable OS, well done .. super happy with it!!"
5.0,LOVE IT~,"I know it was cheaper when I bought it than it is now,"
5.0,This is perfect for those who want a functional,"I've had this same laptop before and it lasted 7 years.  I don't play video games or use a lot of storage.  This is perfect for those who want a functional, portable, reliable computer and don't wish to pay $500 +"
1.0,Solución urgente,La computadora tiene meses de comprada y ya no prende ... tiene problemas con la batería
1.0,Total waste of money! World's slowest computer!,This computer is so slow it's not even usable. It takes 5 minutes for the document folder to open. What a joke!
4.0,Slow... and the touchpad is erratic.,"I'm kind of disappointed... This would've been a good computer for the price if it weren't so erratic when it came to speed and the touch pad... I'm going to hang on to it for a while, unless it freezes completely, and then move on to something else.  It's all about the Benjamins, and this is all I can afford for the time being."
5.0,It's a Dell!,"Lots of things go into the creation of a good product.  Dell has done just that: made a good, no, very good product and I am ever so pleased with the way it performs.  It is not for the ""gamer"", it is just for simple folk like me who need it to email, write letters, chart things and browse the net.  It is, in a word, perfect."
5.0,"Entry level price, high end features!","I purchased this laptop to replace a 9 year old model laptop. This HP was simple to set up and use. The numerous updates on functionality, ease of use and slick design are my highlights."
1.0,Worst laptop ever,Worst laptop ever! Within two days it completely stopped working. Called dell and they wanted more money and still dont fixed. Looked up the issues we're having and apparently numerous people had this same problem with this same model. Save your money!
4.0,Dell Yeah,My son needed something decent on the cheap for work. Works fine right out of the bix
1.0,Will have to buy upgrades,"Very slow, if you want a cheap laptop that's what you will get. You will spend 400$ just on upgrades. Hdd or hard disk drive is out dated tech that will make you want to pull your hair out waiting minutes just for something to open from desktop"
5.0,Five Stars,"i love it, for the price it's the best. life baterry its amazing"
3.0,Battery short,It was easy to set up.  It takes you through the set up fast.  The draw back is the battery is only about 3 hours and you need to plug in.
1.0,Wont charge,"It keeps saying that the cord that came with it is wrong and wont charge the battery. I dont want to send the laptop back, but cant figure out how to contact the seller to see if they can send a power cord to see if that fixes it."
5.0,laptop,great price and convenient and easy to use
5.0,fast shipping& reasonable pricing,beautiful  computer  at a reasonable  price
1.0,junk laptop,"I received this laptop quickly and it was in working order. Amazon did a great job. However, the laptop is junk. It doesn't work properly. Half of the time it won't even turn on. When it does, it is extremely slow. Not happy at all. Dell should be ashamed for even making it."
1.0,Awful do not purchase!,"Horrible. SLOW!  Not sure what the issues are, but this is the slowest computer I’ve ever owned."
4.0,College student it’s perfect,"Say what you want about dell, they have been pushing computers since the cows had a share in stock. Package arrived factory sealed computer is clean and smooth runs a little slower then your “high performance” pooters honestly my wife loves it I love it it runs great and arrived new... plus it’s a Dell.... we deffinently needed this for school and she loves her early Xmas present... happy wife happy life!"
3.0,Good value,For the price it's about what I expected. Functions well. Negatives are a less than stellar screen and as other reviewers have commented it is very slow. I would purchase this again and am pleased with the item. I consider it a good value.
5.0,Happy wife.  Happy life.,"This was an anniversary gift to my wife.  She likes that the laptop is light weight, has the number board and is easy for her to do research on."
3.0,Weight,"I specifically ordered this computer based upon what it offered and its listed light weight. According to the information, the computer was supposed to weight 3.6 pounds. It weighs  4.8 pounds according to our scales. That does not sound like much -- until you add it to a bookbag and carry it up 40 steps in a 100+ year-old school. And, of course it cannot be returned after opening..."
2.0,You get what you pay for,I had to uninstall and reinstall the audio drivers 5 times before I finally got sick of it and returned the laptop. It would randomly stop playing audio through the headphones and only come out the speakers. The processing speed is slow and the material feels cheap.
5.0,Good Value,"I purchased this for my wife, and she loves it. She has thousands of photos that she keeps on it and the graphics let her show them off. It performs other tasks quite well, such as word processing and spreadsheets. I will probably update the hard drive to an SSD at some point, but not right away. It's a great machine for the money involved."
2.0,"Basic, maybe a lil less!!!","Nothing exciting.... Slow as a snail... Good for documents but anything multimedia related, just forget about it.. I use it for coding class and it's giving me bare minimum speed."
1.0,Don't buy this one!!,Biggest pile of doo. Don't waste your money because all this is is a paper weight.  An expensive paper weight.
4.0,Good for the basics,"The second time was the charm, the first laptop came and it was DOA, this second one boots up but lags. Good for email and normal surfing"
1.0,Don't waste your money,It really is a cheap computer that can barely do anything. Save your money and buy something else. I'll never buy another Dell regardless of cost based on my experience with this computer. A galaxy s7 cellphone is more capable then it.
5.0,Easy,Easy to use
4.0,Dell use to be a good brand,To slow to download and stook
1.0,Disappointment,"Very disappointed in the quality of this laptop. I did not want to purchase a expensive laptop mainly because this one would only be temporarely, but the mainframe kept glitching and the software system was extremely slow. I am not a person that usually writes customer reviews, but I couldn't help myself this time due to my experience. Hope I can still get my money back."
1.0,One Star,wish i could return it. Can't run anything on it because it is too slow. Buy any other laptop
4.0,Not upgradeable,"Bought it for my son, he said it works great for his college classes. But it’s not upgradeable."
1.0,I bought this to work not sit there and do nothing,It's a dud worked one day now it will do nothing at all very sorry I bought it would like to send it back but it already has my info on it and no way to remove it. Will never buy another laptop from Amazon.
5.0,"Great price, works great for my application (work from ...","Great price, works great for my application (work from home, interact with my office), I'm not a fan of the touchpad, but I bought a wireless mouse and it is PERFECT"
1.0,Not a good  product,"Just to boot up the computer,  I have to wait at least 20 minutes. When using the computer with Word or quickbooks or any app or internet use, the computer takes minutes to process a transaction or go to the next page or even save a document.  Now we are past the 30 day return window with an almost useless computer."
5.0,Would not reccomend,Very slow right out of the box
5.0,"Big clear, crisp screen",Bought this for my son who is homeschooled this year. Easy setup. So far he loves it.
1.0,SLLLLOOOOWWWWW...... And frustrating,Didn't expect much for the price but this might be slower than the one I had to replace because it was old and slow. I just use it as a home computer for work and do VERY basic tasks such as internet and cloud based Google programs. Dont waste your money.
5.0,Student,Gift for granddaughter
1.0,SLOW,This computer is so slow it bairly starts up. I could not even get it to recognize my printer because it kept freezing up.
4.0,"Low ram, replace windows with linux or get some more/ rest of laptop good",I got my laptop from Emily's store and it was in good condition. I immediately changed the Operating System to Ubuntu and then I cracked open the shell. There was two  ddr4 sodimm slots. I plan on putting a 16 gb kit or another 4 gb sodimm ram stick into the enpty slot. Most of everyones problems stem from how much ram memory windows needs. If you need windows then try to get a professional to install some more ram since you will be voiding the warranty if you attempt to do this.
5.0,Out Standing!!!,This is a great laptop for the price. Go DELL!!!!!!
4.0,Solid Internet Laptop,Good value laptop for general computing and internet usage.
1.0,This is a very S-L-O-W machine.,S L O W.  Period.  It was so frustrating I returned it.
1.0,Don't buy this!,This is the most absolute worst laptop I've ever wasted my money on.  Bought it less than three months ago and it's already shot.  Shuts itself down and gives an error message from turning it on. Then repeats to shut down.  Was slow from the moment I got it.  I'll no longer buy a Dell because of this.  Don't buy this laptop
3.0,"Works good, but is slow and often reboots for no apparent reason","Works good, but is slow and often reboots for no apparent reason"
5.0,Birthday,Gift for family member
1.0,Slower than a turtle in molasses!,"We have had the computer < 2 months and this system is slower than our old computer from 5 years ago doing the same tasks.  I will reach out supplier but it is now beyond the return window.  I don't know what to do but I would never buy this system again, nor would I recommend anyone else to either."
3.0,Laptop Speaker Not Great,"The laptop is ok for the money except the speaker is not very good. When I ran a diagnostic trouble shooter, it said there is a generic speaker detected. I don’t think there is anything that can be done for that."
1.0,this is crap,if it was any slower it would be off.
2.0,Two Stars,I ordered this computer and The speakers have static!  What the heck!  Is this a refurbished/used computer?
3.0,Glad I purchased,So far so good
2.0,I have owned multiple computers over the years and never had one behave like this one,"This computer is defective.  I bought to replace one I already had that was several years old, and starting to have serious problems.  I just opened the box two weeks ago when the old machine finally quit.  This one has been nothing but trouble.  It freezes up constantly.  I have worked with both Dell and Microsoft to try to resolve the problem, this morning when I went to restart it after an upgrade, it refuses to come back on. I have owned multiple computers over the years and never had one behave like this one.  There has to be something defective in the computer itself.  Where do I send it to return it?  And how do I get my money back?"
1.0,My first Dell. It will also be my last.,"I have had issue after issue with this computer, starting with it not charging, then it wouldn't connect to Wi-Fi, and now the caps lock button won't turn off. Every time I tap it my computer freezes up. How do I return this thing?"
3.0,Three Stars,For a last minute purchase when our daughter quickly needed a laptop its ok.
5.0,Dell makes a good computer.,"Use this computer for gaming and watching dvds.  Works great, very good graphics, good screen resolution."
4.0,Unfortunately this laptop is a piece of CRAP. Got it on May 16th and on June ...,"Unfortunately this laptop is a piece of CRAP. Got it on May 16th and on June 28th it does not run any programs. Initially, it was at best, adaquate and sensing that more problems could arise I should have followed my gut and retunred it. By now I have I have missed my one month window to return it. Now I am stuck with this non functional piece of garbage. I am not a millionaire that can afford to lose $300.00 at a pop."
1.0,Beyond slow,The laptop takes around 5 minutes to start up. Out of the box the cpu steadily ran at 95% with no apps open. Takes a long time to launch an such as Excel. Laptop was returned
1.0,When you buy a product that works.,Did not even get to use it to the capacity because it would over hit and turn off. Very poor quality product!
