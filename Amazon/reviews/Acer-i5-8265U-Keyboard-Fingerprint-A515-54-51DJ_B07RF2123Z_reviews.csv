5.0,Need a laptop for productivity work and light gaming for a good value?,Â The Good:
5.0,Great Laptop! Couldn't be happier,I spent hours looking for a nice and affordable laptop and this Acer Aspire is what I landed on.
2.0,"Looks good on paper, but not worth it in reality","I've had good experiences with my past 2 Acers, and this one looks GREAT on paper - 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, modern i5 Intel processor, 1080p IPS screen, etc. So, I had high hopes for it. I thought this would be a solid replacement for my 7-year-old Acer Aspire V3 that's starting to fall apart. But in reality, this laptop is not worth getting. A lot of the other reviews on this page are those ones where they get a free laptop in return for leaving a review, so be weary of their glowing praises."
5.0,gorgeous graphics at lightening speed,"this is an awesome laptop great for editing film. the imaging and speed are top notch.  the sound card could be better, but not enough to take a way a star. excellent value!"
5.0,Great Laptop for the price,"This is a budget laptop that doesn't have a budget feel.  Setup is very simple, even with the minimal amount of manuals and documentation you find in the box. It's very literally a plug and play experience."
5.0,Good Laptop,"I'm very pleased with this laptop. The speed of processing is more than adequate for most needs. I would prefer to have 16gb of memory as opposed to the 8gb I have, but then I like to run VMs and containers as well as do standard work. For standard work, this laptop is good. The keyboard is nice and large and responsive. The touchpad works very well, either through touch alone, or by clicking it, right & left. The image quality is good and the graphics processor decent. I tested it with a few movies and it's great. I'm very happy that it has USB-C as well as regular USB, something every laptop should have these days. The power brick is nice and small. The battery life is good, but not great. I really like how the screen opens very wide, making it much easier to use on oddball surfaces (I present for a living and you can have your laptop in some spots). This is not a powerhouse super graphics engine of a laptop, but that's fine. It's a solid work horse that will get the job done."
5.0,Current technology is fast and easy to set up,"The Acer Aspire 5 has a 15.6"" Full HD IPS Display,  the new, 8th Gen Intel Core i5-8265U processor and an adequate amount of  RAM (8GB DDR4). The 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD main storage is fast and quiet, it supports long battery life because you don't have a disk spinning all the time the laptop is powered up. I like the backlit keyboard with the separate numeric key pad.  I also like the fingerprint reader to allow for secure logon without remembering another password.The unit is slim, but a little heavier than I expected."
5.0,"Spec for spec, great value",You can't win with cheap laptops or chromebooks.  If you want to save money while getting the best specs on your (laptop) computer...look no further.
5.0,He knows computers and this one is really solid!,"My son is a computer scientist. He programs computers and creates software for a living. He gives this laptop five out of five stars. He says it is a solid laptop. It runs well and starts up fast. It has a well-lit screen and keyboard which is really nice. It has a wide and easy to view screen and the battery power is ""decent."" I asked my son specifically to review this so the readers will get a good review to read about this laptop. My son recommends it. And this is high praise."
5.0,This is a nice machine,"It's light, it's fast, it has great graphics. Sound is decent and definitely good enough for your average user. I didn't use the fingerprint reader, but I'm sure it will be a handy feature for some. I love the backlit keyboard, and I like the feel of the keyboard.  I usually hate typing on a laptop, but I don't with this one. This also comes with some decent programs built in."
