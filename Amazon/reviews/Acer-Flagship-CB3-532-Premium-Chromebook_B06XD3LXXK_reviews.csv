5.0,Excellent Alternative to Windows PCs...FINALLY!!!,"Excellent Alternative to Windows PCs...FINALLY!!!  New, this is around $300, mine is ""Refurbished"" for $188.  And if it holds up which I think it will, I am walking away from Microsoft with their never ending PROBLEMS and BUGGY PRODUCTS.  One thing, Chromebooks don't have DVD/CD Drives or Hard Drives (a Negative and a Positive) but they offer abundant Cloud Storage (a Positive and a Negative).  No Drives means very few moving parts to break and very little heat to dissipate...I don't think they even have fans!  Well, I am willing to spend $188 to test out this alternative path from MS which I have been searching for for years, Chromebooks have no Operating System other than the Chrome Browser.  Google provides lifetime Free Virus Protection, An Entire Suite of Office Apps called Google Docs (no Outlook or MS Works needed...YAY!) plus Hundreds more Apps at No Charge!  Try it, You'll Like it."
5.0,excellent. What pleasantly surprised me,"This was a replacement for another Chromebook so the performance was as expected eg. excellent. What pleasantly surprised me , because I hadn't given it any thought , was that all my sites were there complete with remembered passwords. Chromebooks are the best buy for the buck."
5.0,"the keyboard is great, and even though it doesn't have too many ...","I bought these, specifically, for my 4 kids whom I homeschool. I didn't want anything outlandishly expensive; just very basic. Something they can do their schoolwork on, typing courses, etc. This computer totally fits the bill. The screen is big, the keyboard is great, and even though it doesn't have too many bells and whistles, this is perfect for our needs. And the price?! YOU BETCHA. Totally satisfied with our purchase."
2.0,"Solid Chromebook, but far from ""Premium""","I have to start off by saying that I'm a Chromebook fan. I've tested several and owned a few. There are still apps (when I was growing up, we called them ""programs"" and ""software"") that will only run on a PC, but I try when possible to take a Chromebook with me wherever I go because they are just so damn handy. Why is this important? Because this review is not here to hate on Chromebooks. They are great little machines. Many reviews hate the OS, and don't focus on the hardware when writing their reviews."
5.0,Awesome!,I’m highly impressed with this laptop! The price is unbeatable and the computer itself works flawlessly considering it is Certified Refurbished
5.0,Great Chromebook. Does everything my wife needs.,"I purchased this for my wife to use in the Master's program she has started. She was frustrated by our old computer, and this works like a breeze. The Chromebook OS lets her have immediate start-up, while our Office 365 account allows her to use a full host of Microsoft products online, if she needs something outside the Google products. She had been extremely pleased and wished she would have purchased a Chromebook years ago."
5.0,... to get a chromebook simply because i do not like windows i got this today and really expected to ...,i have had about 4 laptops int he past 10 years -after my last one i decided to get a chromebook simply because i do not like windows
5.0,What a deal,I will tell you this is a great buy.I can not believe the price and the product is great.I am so happy with my decision on this purchase.It moves very fast and adding external usb drive works fine .
1.0,BUYER BEWARE- STOPPED WORKING COMPLETELY AFTER ONLY 6 WEEKS AND NOW WE CAN'T RETURN IT!,"At first, I loved this laptop. It was easy to set up. Loved the big screen and ease of use. Unfortunately a few days ago I started to notice it glitching. It would black out and turn off in the middle of using it. It blacked out yesterday and now it won't come back on. It's only 6 weeks old so this  is a huge disappointment. The even bigger disappointment is we are past the 30 day return policy. Now we are stuck with a laptop that doesn't work. There are risks to buying refurbished items."
1.0,After not even 6 months of light to medium use ...,After not even 6 months of light to medium use my computer no longer works. The screen is all messed up. I would not reccomend.
5.0,"Refurbished, really!","Refurbished, really."
5.0,Amazing!,"I wanted to get a laptop for my stepdad because his was infected with so many different things that it didn't work properly anymore. So, when I saw this I couldn't believe my luck at the amazing price! I got it in the mail yesterday and set it up for him so it would be ready when he got home from work. It runs so smooth;y that I couldn't believe it! It answers commands immediately, the display color is fantastic, it has great speakers, he can use a regular mouse on it, and SO many other things! I'm EXTREMELY happy with this purchase, and my stepdad was even happier. THANKS GUYS!"
5.0,Great deal - Great Chromebook!  AAA+++,Great deal - Great Chromebook!  Arrived today and booted up instantly with great performance. I was up and running in minutes.  For the price its perfect for my school classes and budget.  The display is HUGE and clear for my needs.  Its a NON-GLOSS display and perfect for all the basics.  Good keyboard and soft touch keys. It also has plenty of room to rest your palm so thats nice but I always use an external mouse.  I never had a Chromebook and was surprised there is NO Delete Key. I looked over and over and NO delete key.  I find that when you Right Click you can delete stuff.  I thought it was listed as Black its really a Dark Charcoal Grey which I love even more!  Professional packing and all.
1.0,I'm glad it happened before 30 days,"The charging port is broken.  Just like that, the chromebook doesn't charge at all.  This happened the third week of use, I'm happy I can still return.  Be wary of refurbished, it's basically saying that it is either broken or will break shortly."
4.0,Scratch-less,"As a student, im not exactly rolling in money but needed a laptop for school so a Chromebook was a given. This product shipped on time, had no visible scratches and the cheapest i have found and has had no problems in these first few weeks. The only thing thats not quite as good as i wanted (given the price isn't a big deal at all) is just the track pad is a bit finicky. all being said is a solid product and i wasn't even able to tell it was refurbished."
5.0,A Great Deal,"Ok.  I've had this for several months now, and it is a great value.  First off, there are some suspect reviews that say it does not stream video.  That is absurd.  Streaming is what it is designed to do, and it does it very well.  Considering what you are paying, the top mounted speakers are great.  Then the reviewer told of dried-on food and other nonsense (while giving it a 5 star review).  Come on, man."
5.0,I love the Chrome platform and I would get one myself ...,I purchased this for a friend and now I'm jealous.  I love the Chrome platform and I would get one myself if I could get one equipped with a much larger hard drive.  I currently use the Chrome browser in my Windows 10 laptop.  It's super quick and a lot more reliable.
2.0,The charger might not work.,"The laptop came in good condition (as expected because it was refurbished). But the charger was defective. I plugged it in and the charging light wouldn’t show. I called Acer support line and they said either the laptop or the charger might be defective. However, I went to Best Buy and purchased a new charger because I needed to use the laptop immediately. Now, the laptop is working perfectly and the new charger is great. The photo below shows the defective charger (in white) and the functional charger I purchased (in black)."
5.0,Remember what ChromeOS is made for: Web apps.,"This is a good computer for what it is, and what it is is a Chromebook. That means it is a laptop running Google’s Chrome OS. The operating system is fast and very user friendly."
5.0,Grate priced laptop for un techy person,Screen is okay for price point latpop is big for the price keys feel good touch pad tracks good and clicks aubile but not to loud it has 2 big speakers grate sound beyond suprised wirh sound  quality and love the sumilted metal finish. I  Recommend A Egiant 15.6 laptop sleeve with pocket fits your laptop is tuff and holds charger and laptop and some writting pens and penclias and maybe a small not pad
1.0,problem with the laptop I got from you,this equipment I bought from you cant be used.  I cant even install office on it. this Laptop has field me.  If you have a better one in stock I can choose from and seed this one back will be of help.  please hep I am losing my customers.
1.0,"Not quite refurbished, terrible response from seller!","Our second Acer, loved the first for almost 3 years. This was its replacement, but has a high pitched whine when operating. Can’t deal with the noise!  This seller should be avoided at all cost. Poor response, returned the defective device, in their possession for three days and no word from seller!  I will never do business with them again!"
5.0,Great for this Teacher,"I was in the market for a Chromebook to do my school work on as an educator and not break my pocketbook purchasing it. This one fit the bill. So far so good. I have been using it daily, numerous times a day for over a month now. It is a great laptop for my educational classroom needs."
1.0,Terrible Customer Service!,"The Chromebook was much  heavier than the specs listed in Amazon.com said it would be (2.6 lbs), more than twice as heavy (around 6 lbs)! It worked fine for the first two weeks. Then it went dark and would not turn back on even though it was fully charged. I returned it to the Acer store that I purchased it from using the Amazon instructions and return labels. I was surprised that I had to pay return postage to UPS ($21).  UPS reported delivering it on 10-29-18 and as of today 11-8-18 I have not heard back from Amazon or the Acer Store about my refund. I've written to them twice and have heard nothing! This is terrible customer service from both the Acer Store and Amazon.com! Beware!"
5.0,First Chromebook,"9/29/17 Update:  After using this for awhile I wish the keyboard had a ""Delete"" key. No issues though."
5.0,Acer Chrome book,It was a gift for senior citizens. They had it working in minutes from unboxing.
5.0,Been playing games on it non stop while streaming videos and it just blends if u multi tasking and are addicted to YouTube like myself.,"First time using chrome wanted windows 10 but haven't had to use my phone anymore and I no longer charge then since this helps me do everything I need at light speed! Been playing games on it non stop while streaming videos and it just blends if u multi tasking and are addicted to YouTube like myself....it's a powerful laptop for a Chromebook I've run multiple pages in HD videos streaming with very minimal lag (due to area of internet). But what I love the most is the charger which is very important as to how long ur laptop will last, not only is it super fast at charging but it is delicate and easy to plug in and it pops off as a safety mechanism I believe...either way it never overheats it charges really fast even during heavy use and it has options to really dim down the screen to save energy. It's like a tablet but you can do way more and run apps with easy... A must have if you like to entertain your family or others as the speakers on this babe are crisp and clear. It's also light and it comes with this cool bubble wrapping packaging that I've been using in between my lap and the laptop and for storage . My fav thing about this is it's taken over my use or cravings to even use a mobile or smartphone/iPhone which is only explained by how easy it is to get everything social media done on a Chromebook while I do plan to get a Dell that runs windows 10 this is really good to save ur other devices from the load social media and YouTube can out on a device built to run more complex programs.  So get one for sure and forget about charging ur phone and looking like a boy who can out down his Gameboy lol jk"
2.0,DOES NOT COME WITH CORD,WARNING: my package came without the charging cord. When I asked Amazon to issue a credit so that I could buy a cord on its own they would not offer any solution other than return and refund of the entire item.
5.0,"So far,  So good","So far, very happy with this Chromebook. For my daughter, for college. Very different than a Windows-based computer,  but not too hard to figure out (And there is LOTS off online help and tutorials!)  Would certainly recommend!"
1.0,started having trouble,2 weeks ago I started having problem using my earphones ...they would  intermittently stop working.... now they will not work at all...Saturday it stopped charging....... all started 95 days after I received... not happy....also sticky keys. They responded to my e-mail  over 30 days after I sent notice to them...do not recommend. UPDATE  Nov 14 2018....stopped working altogether this AM..... Very disappointed in this piece of junk
5.0,Really fantastic device,"I've been curious about chromebooks since I've sent two kids off to college. I bought this one because the price was ideal for me to try it out! Overall, I've been extremely pleased."
5.0,Excellent! Use it daily for my remote job,"Excellent! Use it daily for my remote job. Functions fast and efficiently! Screen is large 15"" with great graphics. In general ""Love it!! """
1.0,Quit Charging 92 days after I purchased it,"Laptop is fair. It's slightly slow but is good enough speed if you use it to just surf the internet like I do. However, on day 92 after I bought it the laptop stopped charging. Local repair shop said it was a hardware malfunction and would cost $154.99 to fix, which is the cost of a new computer. Thought since it was only 2 days outside the warranty the seller gives (90 days), they might work with me. I could understand if they didn't but then they went out of their way to say I bought it 129 days ago and is far outside the warranty. That just isn't true and I don't feel this seller is honest or the laptop is built for long term use."
4.0,Great second computer for picture storage.,I was pleasantly surprised by the size and quality of this Acer .
2.0,Love it- Kind of,"For what I bought it for, it serves its purpose perfectly. I am very happy after using it for a week now. We had a Macbook Air and one of my humans spilled water on it. Game over. Couldn't afford another one so after doing some research this is a perfect band aid for a little picture management and Netflix watching. My daughter uses a Chromebook for her class so this was also a plus. Very budget friendly and we have a laptop again in the household."
2.0,Chromebooks aren't as good as Windows machines,My first and probably last chromebook.
4.0,Good affordable computer,"The laptop is great but if you have it closed sometimes it shuts off unexpectedly, so when you turn it back on you have to restore the tabs you had open."
5.0,Great!,"This is exactly what I was looking for! It’s ridiculously easy to set up and use! If you have a GMAIL account it seriously does all the work for you,just put in your email address adjust some settings and there ya go all done lol"
4.0,Great quality for the money,"I bought this as soon as I got my taxes back because I needed something if I were to keep writing. I got a Chromebook because I only needed something with basic stuff. I did not need anything extra. My accounts are linked to Chrome so the set up was SUPER easy. Sometimes it lags but I don't know if that is because of my network or the laptop itself. Either way, it is not bad at all. I know it's not a touch screen but I had one before this and I kept wanting to select options by touching the screen haha. So it was an adjustment for sure but it works for everything I use it for and I have no real complaints!"
1.0,Worst laptop ever," If I could give this laptop a 0 star I would unfortunately I’m stuck having to give it a 1 star. Please people don’t be fooled by the price because I had this laptop just for half an hour and it began to start static and we weren’t able to download windows and sketchup. I definitely would not recommend this to anyone trust me. So you’ve been warned, to each is own!!!!!!"
5.0,Acer Refurbished Laptop (Impressed by its used quality)," Wow! This refurbished Acer/Chromebook is nice! There is no clue it isn't brand new from the factory! It has a simple layout set up for Chrome web browsing, once it's turned on it already has a full charge and welcomes you (the new owner) to easily navigate getting started with step by step instructions. Which is very important when it's a gift for someone not so tech savvy as my 60yr old mother. Moves thru each step quickly, no lag, and provides continued instruction even after set up. Speakers and volume level is loud enough in a quiet place but you may need head phones in a louder atmosphere. Durability may not survive dropping or slamming it around because Amazon originally sent one that somehow was damaged in delivery and had to contact me to send out another. It does come in a bubble case that is pretty darn impressive but clearly still took damage in shipping process soo judgement call would be too not slam it around... i would hope. Battery life is good for now, she charged it over a 4 hour period on Dec 27th two days after Christmas, and has said she hasn't charged it since, today is the 31st! Granted most of us would be streaming video & such which takes a lot of battery life. So you make that judgement call.  And she's played hours of spider solitaire laying in bed. She loves it so I'm happy."
5.0,Great computer for the money,I give this 5 stars.
5.0,"Overall, WOW! But slightly disappointed....","So I ordered this Acer Flagship CB3-532 15.6"" Chromebook that I am currently writing this review on. I placed the order on October 14 and it arrived on October 17, which is AMAZINGLY fast shipping that I did not pay extra for! I bought this laptop for $169, two days after i bought it the price dropped to $133, so pretty disappointed that I didn't even wait longer or no one offered me a discount or something......but anyways.......The laptop is sleek and pretty, no signs of being used. So far I've had no problems but let's be honest, I've only been on it for less than two hours. BUT when I first turned on my new computer it was running very slow (I'm blaming it on the fact that the battery was completely dead when i got it) and sat frozen on third set up screen for almost 30 minutes I was worried my laptop was no good...but it's been fine since then. This isn't my first Chromebook but my old one was smaller so this 15.6"" screen is way better, I just wish it was touch screen."
4.0,"Solid, Lightweight Computer and Great Value","It does its' job.  Connects fine to the Internet, gets my email, watches Twitch and YouTube, etc.  Works well with Google Docs as well.  If i have too many tabs open in my browser the laptop tends to get laggy.  Overall, though you can NOT beat the price.  My first laptop was $2,800 and it had a small gray and black LCD screen and it weight as much as a small elephant, so obviously I have seen a lot of laptop generations.  I never thought we would be at a price point where you could get a computer at this price point -- especially with a 15.6"" monitor and a battery that lasts hours.  The screen could be a little clearer (although I'm old) and I would love a lighted keyboard, but I recommend this computer -- especially at this price point.."
4.0,"As long as you're expecting what you get, you should be happy....","The Chromebook is basically a glorified tablet in the shape of a lappy.  I don't mean that in a bad way; that's just what the product is.  I wanted something for lite to medium duty, basic everyday online activity and my work as an online tutor.  I write a lot, so a lot of online research, and watch a lot of videos I've downloaded else where.  I figured this would be good for all that, and I think I was right.  You basically have functionality like a tablet:  Everything is done by, on or through the web, including storage.  You can't install programs, this thing has no hard drive.  You CAN download apps from the Google Play Store, and you will find most of what you want for free.  I was worried that I wouldn't be able to watch videos that I downloaded elsewhere on a USB drive, but it works fine.  Haven't tried music like that yet, or ebooks....the latter of which I doubt if there is any way to open unless they were purchased on this machine."
5.0,Great chromebook,"The laptop is EXTREMELY fast, much better than I anticipated.  I use it to do homework while watching TV, instead of using our desktop.  It's a chromebook, but I search the internet faster than prior gaming laptops I've owned.  The machine runs like a champ.  This was one of the best purchases I've made in the past couple of years.  You usually get what you pay for, but this is a bargain and a great machine."
4.0,Fills the bill at an excellent price,"My kids took over my other computers, so I decided to get one of my own.  I enjoy the convenience of having a personal computer where all my passwords are mine, etc.  This computer is sometimes a little slow, which was disappointing.  But I suppose that it what I get with a dual-core.  It doesn't have any other issues. I use it for email, social media, google docs and spreadsheets, calendar, YouTube, online shopping, and the like.  I don't use it for gaming or music, so I can't say how it would do for that.  It holds a charge very well!"
5.0,So good.. here's the good and the ... not so bad,"Got this for my mom, who surfs the internet, reads emails, watches videos."
5.0,easy to use,"My girlfriend loves it! Big screen, decent speakers on the sides, USB ports, easy to use, great price. Only con is the touchpad isn't the greatest, but with all the pros this Chromebook has, can't even complain that much."
5.0,I'm new to chromebook but it's good!,"This is my first chromebook and although I am still confused at how to get it to do some things that I've always done on Windows PC, I am impressed. This doesn't act like a refurbished item at all and is very fast. I like that it turns on automatically when I open it. The packaging was plain but very secure and my laptop came without a scatch! I saw some others say they hadn't gotten a charging cable but I think they just missed it. You have to dig all the way to the bottom of the box, where there is smaller piece of cardboard separating the charging cable from the rest of the packaging. I almost missed it myself and was worried I would have to return. Overall, I really like it even though I'm new to chromebook."
5.0,they are very happy with their Acer,"It was a gift,  they are very happy with their Acer... I though It was a regular laptop but it  was what they call a tablet??? as long as they are happy I am happy!"
5.0,the screen looks awesome and text size can be modified,"I was looking for something lightweight and fast. This is both of those. Going from a Windows OS to the Chrome OS was something I wasn't sure about. I've always used Windows, but I bought my 81 year old mom a Chromebook for Christmas, and she loves it. I figured if she can figure it out, I can too. Setup is simple and straightforward, just log into your Google account, if you have one. If not, you can create one.. I bought a flash drive for pics and files. I added my VPN, that setup was simple too. The price can't be beat, the screen looks awesome and text size can be modified. I'd definitely recommend this"
5.0,Incredible Product for the Price,"This was my first time making a computer purchase on Amazon. Wasnt a big deal since it was for my kids to do homework and with such a reasonable price i figured why not. I was soooo amazed once I opened the package. The computer was refurbished but it looked brand spaking new to me!  I the screen was nice and wide. I seriously wanted to give my children my laptop and keep this 1.This is definitely worth the buy! my daughter is headed to college an i will be making a purchase again to present as a graduation gift. Its not heavy or bulky, again its a great screen size and resolution, everything works as expected! Im really impressed and did i mention the price....very much worth it!"
5.0,My daughter loves it,My daughter recently change schools and at their old school they needed Apple but at her new school she's used Chromebook. To get a Chromebook at this price is so worth it she is so excited and has no problem navigating through different websites. I'm absolutely buying another one for my sons.  The seller was super nice and sent me an e-mail asking to rate the chrome book and if I have any problems email him which I thought it was very kind.
5.0,GREAT QUALITY AND FANTASTIC PRICE,"I am so pleasantly surprised to have found this computer. The quality is outstanding and it almost feels like a ""steal"" with how inexpensive it was."
5.0,Five Stars,Very satisfied with this. Up and working on it within minutes of opening the box.
5.0,Worth it!,"This is my first laptop/Chromebook. I am everything Google, so this works out perfectly! I use a desktop computer and my cell ph mostly, but needed something for downstairs which this works great. It came fully refurbished, clean. Their is 2 scratch marks barely noticeable on the casing, but other than that and for the price of under $150.00 I feel I got an awesome deal."
2.0,Does not work with most of my apps,I wanted to like this computer but I don't. Just about everything I try to download on to the computer including my printer setup it states that it is not compatible or does not support the google operating system. It does me no good if I cannot use it with my apps. It is great for browsing the internet or playing simple games once you figure out the google system. It just does not work for me. I guess I like the windows system better even windows 10 which I hate.
5.0,It set up easy and she seems to be really happy with it,"I bought this for my Partner to replace an older chromebook. She loves it.It set up easy and she seems to be really happy with it. I never thought about buying Refurbished, but now I'm sorry that I didn't do it before. I bought a new laptop at Best Buy and could have gotten a much better one that was refurbished for the price that I paid. Go REFURBISHED"
5.0,"Ah, almost like having a Mac","Finally, something easy to get around on!"
5.0,Good stuff,"Love it. It runs fast, I can watch YouTube/Netflix no problem, the sound is decent, the screen is really big and it's easy to use. No caps key, but I quickly trained myself to hold shift down for a capital letter when necessary, which is often because I use this primarily for my online college classes. Does everything. Had an issue accessing a few web pages at first due to ""privacy issues"" but the problem fixed itself. Haven't met a webpage I cant load.  Highly recommend."
5.0,old son love it. screen is so big and enough fast ...,"My 10 yrs. old son love it. screen is so big and enough fast to process. I think it is very good for school kids to do their homework, net surfing and watching Youtube. and I don't feel it's refub product. Great price."
5.0,My son wanted a large screen.,"Purchased for my son.  Others had more features, but my son wanted a large screen and he was initially very happy.  EXCEPT he says space bar does not work well. I wish he had let me buy him one with more RAM, more GB, SSDL --there were several available with a bit smaller screen. Had we gotten one of those, he would probably be happier.  He recently told me, ""A smaller screen would be ok.""  Unfortunately, as far as I know, it is too late for an exchange. I would be thrilled to purchase him a better one!"
2.0,"honestly not worth it, save up for a few more months for a cheap hp","pretty much only purchased this to transfer media files from a broken hp. some of the files work fine, others don’t - i can’t pinpoint the issue. Apps crash often. had to google on my phone how to reboot it when it froze after two days. (toggle refresh key- arrow circle key near left corner, and power key at same time). keyboard is weird, it’ll take time to adjust. it was cheap so 🤷🏻‍♀️"
5.0,amazing. chromebooks are simply perfect.,i had this for about 7 months and its still going strong. it hasn't broke down on me yet. i mainly use it to browse the web i don't make youtube videos or do heavy task ect.. so this is perfect for me. and if i want to play a game i go on my consoles and do that. i use to browse on my tablet alot but since i got this bad boy this killed my beloved tablet. if you want a buy a laptop without spending 500-1000 dollars(im looking at you apple!) go for a chromebook and its incredibly fast once you turned it on it only takes less then 3-2 minutes to turned on.
5.0,You will love this Chromebook,"Excellent price. I know it was refurbished but you wouldn't know it. The package came with a very heavy bubble wrap, which protected the computer. The set up was plug and ready. I love this Chromebook is the best. I have had Asus chrome books and  I feel that the Acer is the best. I love the large screen. I love it so much that I ordered another one for my husband. I would recommend this Acer to everyone. Easy to operate and fast. Also, don't forget that it has its own Antivirus build right in the computer."
5.0,Perfect for my two budding computer geeks.,"I purchased two of these for my girls. They were perfect for the use they'll receive. Educational apps, learning how to navigate a computer, and of course YouTube and Netflix. The price was very competitive, especially considering that I was looking to purchase two. The delivery was also much faster than anticipated. Thanks seller, the girls loved them!"
4.0,"Great for email, web surfing and word processing","This is my first Chromebook PC. I bought this refurbished so I didn't expect perfection, but it's just right for me until I upgrade to soemething else. It has been very reliable and easy to use. The speakers are at a nice loud volume and it works well with a handheld mouse and just as well! on the mouse on the touchpad. The price was great too!"
5.0,... a 6 year old Samsung Chromebook which I have loved until it finally quit,"I bought this to replace a 6 year old Samsung Chromebook which I have loved until it finally quit.  This Acer is much bigger with its 15.6"" screen.  Right out of the box, as usual the setup was almost instant, and I love the feel of the keyboard.  I saw a sticker saying to open from both ends to find cord, and it is hard to notice when you're excited to get the chromebook out of its packing.  Don't throw the cord away!  It was packed very well."
1.0,I feel very disappointed by the team,"the product is very used, and has many visible blows, which classifies it as class C. I feel very disappointed by the team, now I will have to spend a lot of money to place a case"
5.0,Simply Wonderful and Cheap,Our kid can't seem to hang on to/not spill juice on/not randomly ruin laptops.
4.0,The unit shipping quickly and arrived in good shape. It looks good on the refurbish (no ...,"This was purchased as a gift for my mother-in-law. The unit shipping quickly and arrived in good shape. It looks good on the refurbish  (no scratches or markings)  and seemed to work well for about the first month and then she started having problems with two of the keys on the keyboard sticking. It doesn't make it unusable, it's just frustrating to her, otherwise I would have given it five stars."
5.0,"Good product, reasonably priced.","When my Mac decided to fritz out, I was in the midst of school projects and I needed a fast quality laptop replacement.  This product is reasonably priced and it exceeds my expectations.  No complaints whatsoever."
4.0,Nice serviceable laptop,"My old machine was not updateable anymore, so crashed repeatedly.  This is a good replacement for someone who is not computer savvy and just needs the basics to access the internet, email, etc.  That's all I require of it.  The keyboard is smaller and takes some getting used to and I do miss the number pad , but otherwise has a nice touch to it.  A good size screen for the money too.  And could not beat the price!"
3.0,NO POWER SOURCE INCLUDED!!,"I have not used the computer yet, so this review is strictly based upon my disappointment upon receipt of product.  Although description clearly states that all relevant accessories are included, there is no power source cord included! I reached out to Amazon immediately and they offered a gift card for the cost to purchase one.  However, I feel I should warn others about this scenario as it appears I am mot the first customer to experience this problem.  After receiving the item, I read the questions asked area and see that others were just as frustrated as myself due to the lack of power source.  The computer is meant to be a gift for my nephew and was requested specifically by him via Amazon link.  My lesson learned... although a requested gift; READ EVERYTHING before purchase."
5.0,This thing is NICE !,This laptop is NICE !
1.0,"the only thing I liked about this ""laptop"" was its size","the only thing I liked about this ""laptop"" was its size."
5.0,Excellent laptop!,This machine looks and performs flawlessly!
5.0,Get it before they are gone.,"Extremely happy.  It is light weight, very fast and has a long life battery.  Well worth every penny and I was thinking about getting another because it is so portable. It does not have a dvd/cd player but for the price you can buy an external one."
5.0,Great Chromebook,"I got this after returning another chromebook that felt flimsy and was so slow. The great part is I only paid $30 more for this one that has a bigger screen, solid construction, and fast processing. Buy it."
5.0,A great computer for low maintenance users!,"I am agraid to get a chromebook because a lot of reviews claim they do not stream hulu or Netflix. I have found the computer does just that without any problems. I am getting use to the performance quirks, like no right clicking the traditional way and some other things. But a quick trip to google solved all my problems."
3.0,a-ok,"It has adequate performance for general web browsing. The screen is not that great (resolution is 720p, sensitive to angle). No prob w/ refurb."
4.0,Great sized screen for a solid little laptop,"This 15.6"" used Acer Chromebook works as well as the 14"" one I bought about four or five years ago. It's ideal for surfing the web, checking Gmail, and accessing basic docs and spreadsheets created in Google. While the battery, processor, and RAM size are all average (and that's not to say bad), the bright, clear screen is a real stand-out: I can easily watch movies or YT on here without missing the TV screen. Very pleased with this purchase."
3.0,nice but ...,"Received it yesterday, spent time to set developer mode and install Linux to run side-by-side with ChromeOS and Inexpensive . However, its ram and ssd are quite small and it will erase everything if its modes accidentally switched (-- thus it won't be a reliable software developing platform).  Plus, Google will send me security alerts to my android devices everytime i logged in to this Chromebook  -- kind of annoying, actually."
5.0,Exactly what i needed.,"I'm very happy with my purchase. The laptop came quickly and was well packaged. I was looking for straightforward laptop that wouldn't break the bank. Did some research on chromebooks and found they fit my needs (basic web surfing, simple documents). Went with this one because it hit all my marks. Setup was quick and easy, and the laptop has been everything I needed. Very happy with my purchase!"
5.0,This is a good deal!,I’m retired now and simply don’t need a power laptop with a ton of space anymore.  This also works great with my tiny 1 terabyte external drive.  The action is snappy and streams perfectly with Netflix and Prime videos on its large screen. Amazing deal at $160.  Arrived blemish free.
5.0,Really Nice Chromebook,"Bought as a replacement for a low end Acer Chromebook purchased years back. That cheap unit met the needs of my wife until the screen was accidentally cracked. She picked out this refurbished unit as a replacement. It came well packaged, and looks and operates as if brand new. It is a bit bigger than she wanted, but in all other regards it is perfect."
5.0,Cannot beat this deal!,"Cosmetically, this computer looks brand new and is so sleek! As far as functionality, even better. Connected to my printer in under 2 minutes and starts up and connects to sites quickly. Nice big screen and lightweight. Very happy with this purchase and for the price this is a great deal. Highly recommend."
2.0,Randomly shuts down,"It literally has been shutting down randomly 15 times a day since I got it. It boots up pretty fast and keep my windows the same, so I wouldnt have a probably if it only did a few times a day. But in less than 4 hours of on and off use it's shut down about 8 times."
4.0,Many non-Google Smartphone Android apps don't work well or don't work at all on this Chromebook,"Like the fast boot time, quick maintenance update time and value (lower cost).  Google's Chrome browser and Google brand Apps work great.  However, non-Google Android apps may or may not work great or may not work at all.  Recommended for people who only need good Google branded app performance.  Not recommended for people who need good non-Google app performance.  I'm not a ""power-user"" and sometimes wait patiently a few seconds for an app to refresh or respond to a mouse click.  Occasionally, perhaps monthly, the screen ""freezes"" and I must press and hold down the power button for many seconds to power off/on the device."
1.0,Chromebook malfunctioned right outside return window.Hardware issues Terrible experience.Will cost me mega$$$ to repair/replace,"I didn't have a problem with this machine until right after the 30 day return window expired. I have been having technical issues shortly after. I would get black lines running across my screen, the machine would freeze. I would have to do a reboot. I then received a message to reinstall the operating system. I was able to do that successfully. Once I did that, I did a powerwash just in case. My machine was once again functional...for about 3 hours. Since that time, this has happened a total of 5 times. I've even contacted technical support (ACER)...they were able to help me get up and running the second time, but it still keeps happening. This is the worst experience I have ever had with a product seller. I will not buy an ACER product ever again due to this experience and have bought Chromebooks from other manufacturers as gifts and they are still up and running for years."
5.0,Nursing Student Laptop on a Budget,"Super Happy with this purchase.  NY LPN to RN student looking for a decent laptop for the low low.  I LOVE IT. I take it everywhere I go. All apps open for me. Big enough screen, easy to navigate/maneuver.  Was nervous with this purchase, due to the previous reviews. But you know, you cant listen to what everyone is saying, you have to take chances. Would recommend."
5.0,"I love it, just having a hard time hooking it ...","I love it, just having a hard time hooking it up to my printer.  Can't understand what i'm supposed to do.  Very complicated."
5.0,Great for what I wanted,"Refurbished item functions like new, looks new.  Fast and reliable, but sometimes have to restart it if I've left it on sleep for too long (it refuses to stream videos, gives green screen).  Nice it comes with 100GB free google drive for 1 year.  Great for browsing internet and streaming.  Wanted a lightweight, cheap computer with a keyboard for messaging/emails and streaming anywhere in my house, and that's what I got.  Recommended to a friend for similar use and she likes it too."
5.0,so good! I bought the chromebook for a job that ...,"One week in with the new chromebook and so far, so good! I bought the chromebook for a job that required me to have my own laptop. I wanted something lightweight to carry around. But most importantly I was looking to spend a little money as possible. The value for this is great! The 15.6"" screen was a must for me since I will be doing so much work. The chromebook shipped fast and was packaged for maximum protection. This is a great investment!"
4.0,Laptop is great abd works well,Laptop is great abd works well....but didnt recieve a power cord with it.....do i have to get my own? May have missed that in the fine print
5.0,"Handy backup laptop, battery life is GREAT.","It's not a speed demon, but in general it's not annoyingly slow, and for basic browsing and my web based daily work, it keeps up well enough that I use it often. I have a much stronger work laptop that I use as a primary, but wanted a backup I could keep laying around the house, take on vacation, etc. This is more than enough for that. I can use pretty much any apps that I can install through the Google Play Store, including Zoom (video conferencing), etc. The resolution isn't crazy good, but it's good enough for me."
5.0,Wise purchase,I am glad that I purchased this laptop since it arrived in Mint condition and it works like a charm. I use laptops for my business and I thought to save some money while getting a Good deal. I did both with this purchase.
3.0,It's OK--I was disappointed that after just a few months the action on ...,"It's OK--I was disappointed that after just a few months the action on the touchpad would deteriorate to the point where we can't use it to scroll down anymore on the screen and have to use the arrow keys--the action was always a little ""sticky"" from the get-go but now, it's even worse. I get that this is second hand, but I was hoping for the mechanics to survive longer--luckily we can switch to a mouse--"
3.0,Expect to upgrade ram to 8gb,"This is a good system for the price. However, out of the box it was very slow and lagged quite a bit compared to other 4g ram systems I have had. Increasing the ram to 8gb has helped considerably"
5.0,"Great price, quick ship","Great price, quick ship. Slight scratch across screen, but no concern as it would probably happen soon within my house and kids. Chromebook is fabulous as far as just sign in and verify, then all my bookmarks and set up are transferred to new unit. All goo!"
1.0,Worse customer service and horrible products.,"What a ripoff. I gave 1 star only because it won’t allow me to give none. This seller does not care about their customers. I bought a computer for my son for Christmas and he messed up isn’t he first few weeks, returned it to amazon and had another sent to me in Jan and today it has stopped working. It won’t even turn on. No damage has been done and this seller doesn’t have anything to other than “it’s out of warranty”  no I’m sorry you’re having problems since you bought it, or thank you for shopping with us nothing. That’s fine, I may not get any help from this computer but I will make sure no one I know falls for their crappy products."
5.0,Great,I had to replace my old laptop I only had for maybe three months. It was slow and froze all the time. This one lets me know when I go on an insecure site. Can't believe all the sites I was going on that would not seem harmful. Greatful for this one. Bought it because the reviews said it had a built in spyware or something.
1.0,Malfunctioning hardware right out of the box,Restarted continuously right out of the box and did not include a power cable as well. It was a waste of my time and energy. I had purchased it so I could finish my assignments for my Master degree because my other computer was getting fixed. I had to turn it in late due to the fact I had to find another computer last minute. I wish I got get a refund on the two days I lost because I thought I had purchased a computer that would work.
5.0,Needed this laptop to stream online video to a weekly ...,Needed this laptop to stream online video to a weekly group.  Works well and the picture is very clear.  Well worth the price.
5.0,Bought for my grandfather to do very basic tasks like email and basic web research,Bought for my grandfather to do very basic tasks like email and basic web research.  Serves the purpose well.  Build quality is better than expected for the money.  Screen quality is fairly good.  Wireless range is good.  Battery is great.  Cheap enough that if he breaks it it's not a huge deal.
5.0,"I'm a simple perfect, and this computer is perfect for me","I'm a simple perfect, and this computer is perfect for me. I look at You tube videos, check e-mails, and college assignments. And with the 15.6"" screen makes watching video a great experience. Although, the screen occasionally turns to black when you have a lot of tabs open at once, not a big issue for me, but it's a minor annoyance."
5.0,"Great quality, great price.","This turned out to be a real bargain. It's not my first Chromebook, but it's the one I like the best. Very responsive, has a great feel to it, a nice full-size keyboard, and excellent picture."
5.0,I've had no issues with it and couldn't be more pleased. For the money you can't go wrong with ...,I've has this chromebook for a little over a month now.  When it arrived it looked brand new.  I've had no issues with it and couldn't be more pleased.  For the money you can't go wrong with this.  Buy it now!
5.0,A great bargain.,"A great bargain for a very useable computer. The keyboard and touchpad are really good for this price point, and the screen is fine. It's a bargain computer, and I feel like I got more than I paid for."
5.0,Five Stars,"great deal for the $ ,Nice Big screen,light weight,hdmi,great buy."
4.0,Serves Its Purpose,"Laptop came on time and (mostly) works as expected. There is a key on the keyboard (the apostrophe key) that works only on the second click which is odd. It was HELL trying to get some help with this small but bothersome issue. I simple, even small, gift certificate or money back option should have been offered."
5.0,awesome for the price,aesome for the latptop for the price it was sold. great latop. packaging was tricky but its great so far. the people who sell this product is nice and they took the apology of when i as customer screwed up on opening the packaging./ will give and up date after having it for few months.
3.0,Keyboard feels narrow / screen is nothing to right home about,"The screen is big... but not really HD by any means. I am actually returning it because oddly enough, it feels like the keyboard is much smaller than a normal keyboard so I keep missing keys and have to spend time thinking about how to type on the smaller keyboard which is annoying. It could just be that the keys are tightly spaced and don't have any gaps like the other keyboards I've been used to typing on.."
1.0,Dead in 6 months,"I usually advocate for refurb products but this thing just died and wont charge or turn on. Tried the reset procedure multiple times with no luck. If you buy this thing, factor in the price for the warranty from square trade because you are going to need it."
5.0,Acer for xmas,"Arrived on time, with charger. Turns on, charges, easy to use, light weight and easy set up.  Only thing I found was the touch pad has a very soft push area as if it's been used too much. No issues with it malfunctioning just feels soft in one area."
5.0,Quality,"This was a very good investment at a reasonable price. I was worried because it was refurbished. It works as new. Considering the NEW chromebook I purchased at a Big well known chain (NOT Walmart), that had issues from the beginning, never worked correctly, and I paid 3 times as much. I will buy refurbished electronics again, as they do in fact work as well, or better than brand new."
5.0,Great price.  User friendly.,I was hesitant when I ordered the Laptop.  Its a refurb.  But I was surprised when it arrived. Powered right up. Very nice unit.  I played with it for a minute and was impressed by the quality.  I bought it for our 9 yr old daughter for her Birthday in november.  So It wont really be used until then.  But first impressions.  Cant beat it for  the price! Especially for a 10 yr old!
5.0,It’s a durable computer with a big enough keyboard for me to be able to type.,I love the screen size and picture. Also the fact that I can play my android games on my computer. Plus the fact of how fast it responds and charges are amazing. I also received it three days early from expected date of receipt.
3.0,A good basic chromebook,Slower than our previous one.  Touch pad is nor as accurate as previous version but nothing terrible.  You just have to press a little harder.
5.0,He absolutely loved it. It does everything that he needs,Bought it for my brother. He absolutely loved it. It does everything that he needs. Would definitely recommend!
5.0,Computer for the Future,"Good computer for my future,  It has everything I need.  It runs on Google Chrome OS like a cell phone and google provides virus protection. It links to my PC for printing until I upgrade to a Chromebook compatible printer.  Long battery hours and light weight.  I have been using it for a week and I love it."
3.0,So far so good,Ordered it on the 17th and received it on the 22nd (once again 2 day shipping is non existent from Amazon).
5.0,Five Stars,"All around great, product, shipping, price. Thanks"
4.0,Still in transition from straight Microsoft. Printer interface awkward ...,Still in transition from straight Microsoft.  Printer interface awkward.  Fast and bouncy Google browser  Mouse interface is non-standard.  Left click is reversed with right click.  Still checking out many features.
3.0,"Started laptop for kids ,It's a great buy I would buy it again","I love it  The screen is so awesome, Starts to move a little slow And the mouse paired stars to stick"
5.0,Battery life is amazing,"Best laptop I've had. I had an hp that didnt work like this. I love that all my Google stuff is connected,  so I can type something on my phone, save it to Google docs, n there it is on my laptop when I get home."
5.0,Awesome,"I love this little machine. It does everything it said it would, and surprisingly, more. The battery lasts forever. I'm sure I will keep this great little machine around for a long time."
5.0,Nice sound. Solid machine,"I'm using it now. Big screen. Nice sound. Solid machine,"
5.0,It was satisfactory.,"It was bigger than I thought which is great. This is the second chromebook I have so I wasn't amazed by all the features, but they WERE satisfactory. The speakers also work really well compared to my other chromebook. The packaging is probably what amazed me.....it came in a HUGE box that contained another box which contained a plastic bubble wrap thing  that protected the chromebook. If I could buy this for someone as a present, I would. Overall, I like the chromebook and there isn't really anything that disappointed me. Also the chromebook is WAYYYY heavier than I expected."
4.0,It has been a great replacement for a very old laptop computer,It has been a great replacement for a very old laptop computer.  Perfect for my husband who is retired and only needs a computer to go online for news.
1.0,Simply doesn't turn on only a few months in,The computer won't even turn on only a few months in.  I've tried all of the official hard reset and restart methods and nothing works.
5.0,Works well for this grad student!,Nice and cheap and straightforward. Getz the job done. I am a grad student and mainly just write papers and do Internet research.
4.0,Enjoy a 15 1/2 inch Chromebook @ $186 or maybe better soon,Only 2 GB start-up...enough ffor me...with SSD storage 16 GB and all the space needed free in the cloud at Google Drive.Pre3fer to store nothing on board...laptop works faster.
5.0,Good basic simple laptop with great screen resolution and fantastic price,"Nothing to dislike! I got a great price and it does what I got it for! Not real powerful, not a lot of memory and hard drive,  but didn’t need it for that. Good quality deal for the price!"
5.0,Works perfectly,I bought this for my wife who only uses her computer for email and YouTube . This one was a good deal and best of all She loves it!!!
5.0,Super laptop for the price,I’m in love with my chromebook! For the price it’s well worth it! I’m just a bit irritated that I can’t download ITunes on it but that’s about it for the negatives. All in all it’s a great laptop!
1.0,Reconditioned not recommended...,"I really like this Chrome book. A lot. The only problem is, after 9 weeks, it keeps shutting down. I know, I know...my bad. Other reviewer's complained of the same thing. I just thought I'd take my chances."
4.0,Great battery life,"Can't go wrong with this purchase. Price is perfect too. I've had this for almost a year now and have no complaints so far. Battery life is great. Over 12 hours, couldn't ask for anything more."
5.0,Very happy with this,Very happy with this. Packaging was super sturdy and the Chromebook like new. Easy to use and super simple to set up.
