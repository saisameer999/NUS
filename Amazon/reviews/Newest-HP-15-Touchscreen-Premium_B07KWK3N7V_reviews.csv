1.0,Not a new computer!!!!,"BEWARE!!!!!  Would have really enjoyed this laptop had it turned on after using it for only a week. This was definitely a used laptop since none of the stickers were on the keyboard that normally are found on new HP laptops. I feel totally cheated; they should be required to disclose the fact that you are not receiving a completely new, unopened, computer when purchasing.  I’m returning the laptop ASAP and buying a new one at a reputable brick and mortar store."
1.0,This is why I can't have nice things...,"I bought it new and got a week out of it before it froze while I was in the middle of a word document. I turned it off and it never came back on. It said hardware was not detected. Seriously? It was never dropped, rarely used, and perfectly working beforehand. I don't get it."
5.0,"HP Notebook 15 15.6"" HD Touchscreen","This HP Notebook 15 Windows 10 is used for my business invoices, proposals, banking, paying bills, business apps. It performs flawlessly.  Speedy App load and internet browsing.  It will not be used for gaming so I cannot comment on that. I have not tried web/camera yet either. I replaced my old 2009 Toshiba satellite windows 7 and I am so glad I did.  It is lightweight so would be great for taking with you. I like the black keyboard. Touchscreen works well.  I am pleased with its performance."
5.0,Has more feature than MacBook Pro,Makes it possible to use software I have bought before. Plenty of memory. Touch screen is great.
5.0,Great for The Sims game lovers,"Love my computer, great for playing my Sims4!"
5.0,No light on key board,This product has an absolutely seamless operation. From a Contractors perspective this Lap Top is perfect! Durable but stylish and runs as fast as I need it to! I wish I would of realized the keyboard doesnt lite up but hey who types in the dark anyways lol!!!! Amazing product I'm going to buy two more for my Foremen next week!
5.0,It's a great laptop for the price,"I had to buy a newer laptop with more memory, and upgrade to Windows 10. Not a fan of Windows 10, so wirh windows 7&8 not going to be supported Jan 2020, it wad time. Like anything new it takes time to learn how everything works and make it your own. The drawback for me is I still prefer a mouse and must be careful not to touch the touchpad, otherwise you are somewhere other than where you want to be."
1.0,Stopped working after one use!,Computer came in fine and looked good and worked when I first opened it and used it.  Went to turn it on the next day and I only have a black screen and it will do nothing.  I am returning it as I type!  Very Disappointed!!!
5.0,Cecil's Laptop,This computer is excellent.  I really enjoy it.
2.0,We got a lemon.,"The laptop arrived quickly, but after only using it two weeks, the hardware malfunctioned and apparently the memory was faulty on it. HP sent us a box to have it shipped to their facility for repair. We are currently waiting for them to fix it and send it back. Thankfully we only need it for personal use, and nothing urgent right now, but we weren’t very happy about having to send it back right off the bat only to wait another month before we get it back again. Hoping for the best when we receive it back."
5.0,Very nice computer for college/work,"Very nice computer. I like the touch screen part, and windows 10 comes with it, which is a must. I prefer this over my over-priced MacBook."
