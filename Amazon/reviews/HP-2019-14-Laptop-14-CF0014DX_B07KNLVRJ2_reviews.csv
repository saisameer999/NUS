5.0,Excellent Laptop For the Price,"I love this laptop. I am using it mainly for my school work, I do full time classes at university and some are online. I needed something light and fast that I could travel with. If you are looking for something that is a powerhouse laptop at this price point you are fooling yourself. I am surprised I got this good of a deal on a laptop with a SSD in it. I bought this laptop with the mindset that I wanted something that was fast and could do a light work load because I have a powerhouse gaming Desktop PC at home, so I did not need something over the top in a laptop. I also wanted it to be light for travel. If you are looking for something that will run High FPS Games or Adobe products smoothly I 100% don't recommend this PC. This computer can handle simple games, I like to play My Time at Portia and it can run League of Legends, but most potatoes can, so it's not a gaming PC by any means, but you need to check the Games themselves and see the lowest setting you can run them on (Like you should if you are a gamer and wanting a new laptop)."
4.0,Great Laptop for Price - first impression,"I bought this laptop knowing it wouldn't be a powerhouse. This is a basic laptop that functions well for a great budget price. I bought this for the online classes I am taking and some light internet browsing, aka Pinterest, Facebook, etc. I wouldn't recommend it for gaming or for if you need any software like AutoCad, photo editing software or for work purposes. This is a great personal use computer and for school depending on your degree.  I immediately uninstalled the game pack that came with it. I wish you could uninstall the other bloatware that comes with it, unfortunately I am having a hard time finding it to uninstall. There are so many ""trials"" for games, dropbox, etc. that I don't want popping up all the time hence the 4 stars."
3.0,"Obsolete technology, not a good value","I bought this CF0014DX computer because it seemed an acceptable package at (relatively) affordable price.  I returned it because the network adapter is terrible in my environment.  After finding better options for the buck, I realize this computer is a poor investment for most people."
5.0,Nice laptop,"I bought this in a rush when my Dell died suddenly.  I basically looked at price and the reviews.  I was interested in a home laptop to use for emails, surfing, and Office applications.  I'm very impressed with what I've seen so far.  Good battery life, nice size (14"" seemed a lot smaller than my 17"" Dell, but as noted in other reviews, the design of the keyboard gives me the same keyboard area as my Dell) and it's very lightweight.  No complaints at all.  For the money I think this is a very nice laptop."
4.0,So far so good,"I've only had this for a day, but it looks great in terms of speed and ease. Looks like a good laptop for the price. I will be using it basically for writing and browsing the internet. There was a lot of MS bloatware though, that I got rid of. Only thing, description says Ash Silver, I got Gold. Other than that- looks good. Seller: TechFamily."
5.0,"Good laptop, hasn't frozen yet, even with an i3 processor.","I bought this with on a tight budget. Even though I was kinda doubtful about it having an i3 processor, I am very satisfied with it. I'm currently using it in a nursing program, where I take exams online. It hasn't lagged or frozen during my exams, yet. Hopefully it'll stay like this for the next 2 years. I don't do anything else on it except for school related stuff, and it is runs good enough for my needs."
5.0,High value laptop,I'm really only using this laptop for three things
5.0,"Good simple computer, good value for the $$$","Some reviews compared to a Macbook, which is unfair. This computer costs 1/3 price and you should expect some trade offs for saving that $1000. I am using it only for internet access and simple word processing, spreadsheet tasks. Does those jobs admirably. It is a bit slow to start up and needs a nudge to connect ""automatically"" to my trusted wifi networks. But nothing a couple of seconds patience won't overcome."
5.0,Love it,Just received today and so far I love it!  Super fast. Love that the keyboard doesn’t have the number keypad. Keys are large and easy to type on.  Screen is super clear
5.0,Great laptop for students,"I'm a college student so I needed a laptop that was lightweight, portable, good battery life, and can run multiple programs at once (i.e. Excel, Word, Chrome). I've had this laptop for almost four months now and it has met all of my needs and then some! Battery lasts all day, laptop is extremely light, and I can easily run many programs at once. I got this to replace an older Mac Book Pro, and this is an upgrade in my opinion."
5.0,Solid laptop for the money,"Laptop does what is expected. Make sure to at least upgrade to the 8MB RAM, otherwise expect a slower processing. Otherwise this is a solid low prices machine. I use it for web surfing, word, excel, and powerpoint. Not sure I would expect more from it."
4.0,Very solid so far,Ive had it for about a month. I was tryibg to find a decent laptop for around 400$ that i would be able to work off and stay mobile with. It does everything I need to run my buisness and has pretty good battary life. One thing I really like is how fast it boots up it comes on in seconds and loads programs fast. Browsing speed is really good too and im able to multitask without slowdowns. The screen is good but is subject to glare pretty easily at times. Touchpad is solid as well as the keyboard. Its not incredible in any department but if youre looking for something that can keep up with a fast paced lifestyle it works great. A solid laptop at a great price point. 7/10 in my book.
4.0,Bien por el precio,Buen desempeño por el precio. El ventilador hace un poco de ruido. El espacio del disco duro un poco limitado. Y no es adecuada para procesos de edición complejos. En general muy bien
5.0,Excellent Product for the Price,I bought this product for my wife and she is happy with the laptop.
5.0,For 400 dollars it will suffice.,"A Very mediocre machine, you are paying 400 dollars for it. I bought it for my niece for school. No gaming, no advanced editing or engineering work. Streaming online, writting essays/ powerpoint, and watching movies is what this laptop will be good for. I understood this going in, so please don't expect a supercomputer."
5.0,Great value,"I love the look, size and feel of my new HP. It is super fast with the solid state hard drive. It shipped fast and arrived un damaged. Would recommend for the price point and quality computer that you can throw in a bag and go."
5.0,Buy it!,"Just what we needed it. We shopped around and decided on this one, and so happy we did. We travel a lot, that's we need a lightweight laptop. And this one has it all. Buy it!"
5.0,Great laptop for the price!,"I bought this laptop for my wife for basic needs.  She loves the size and weight of the laptop.  It performs well so far, no issues."
5.0,Great upgrade.,"I use this laptop as a platform that runs to a hub.  The hub operates two monitors, two printers, a backup external drive and a host of other items.  It's fast and efficient.  Plus if I want to unplug to take it with me, it is so portable.  Cool."
4.0,Perfectly Affordable Performance,"Start up is wonderfully fast even with the large amount of easy-to-remove bloatware that came pre-installed. I’ve written several papers on this laptop now and haven’t had any problems. The machine performs exactly as I expected. If I had to pick one negative, it would be wishing that the keyboard were backlit and had a numeric keypad. But alas, I went for a more affordable model and am happier for the money I saved making that choice."
5.0,Great value!,"Bought this for work; I need it for MS-Word, excel, and gmail. The keyboard is fantastic; great key action, not mushy like so many other laptop keyboards. Boots up super fast b/c of the SSD. Runs cool. It's very lightweight and thin. Battery life is average. I'm extremely pleased with this purchase."
5.0,Worth the purchase,"I had to purchase this laptop more out of haste because my previous laptop had complications, but I can say I'm actually quite happy with this one. It worked as expected for me and has a quick running speed for the applications I need as a university student. The smaller size makes it much lighter and easier to carry around in a smaller backpack, which is helpful when you have to walk around and switch to different parts of campus nearly every day. So far there hasn't been any major issues that would have made me give a lower rating, so sverall I'd say that the purchase was 100% worth it and I got the product as expected."
4.0,Quick and light weight,Bought this for a Christmas gift.  It arrived in 24 hours... geez fast!  Daughter loved the speed and how light it was.
5.0,Really great computer for school work,This computer is a lightweight computer. It runs very well. The keyboard is easy to type on. It does not have a VGA port and only has one HDMI port. Very happy with it. Came pre-installed with a bunch of software that took time to delete.
5.0,Sleek,"So far no problems, I thought it came with Microsoft office but it was just a trial. However I am happy with the laptop"
5.0,Nice Notebook for Travel and Desk,"Quick ship. Nice notebook. Hate Win10 and Apps, but use Win7 desktop and menu converter. Screen didn’t seem sharp, but appears to have self adjusted. Besides Win10, very happy."
5.0,Fast and reliable,"SSD makes start up and work fast and easy.  Light, portable and functional.  Great laptop."
5.0,I love it !,"My old Hp laptop went out and I'm a college student so I needed something right away .  This laptop came and it is so lightweight and sleek and feels so good. I love it, the design is good, the keyboard has a wonderful feel to it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a laptop in a pinch. This is such an upgrade from my previous laptop and I love it !!"
5.0,Excellent laptop for the money.,"Best feature is that with a 14"" display it's not as big and bulky as the more common 16"" laptops, but still a good size keyboard and overall features. Shines compared to the new large cell phones on the low end and the big and bulkier laptops above it. Very convenient and highly recommended."
4.0,Basic laptop,Smaller laptop. Dislike not being able to scroll up or down on the touch pad. Dislike not having the number pad on the left. Memory isn't that large. Basic computer
5.0,"Works well, fast, value","I used the computer once following set up. It seems to work well. I was looking for a specific system, combining a i3 processor, SSD drive (128 Go in this case) and 8Go of RAM. Set up was easy, all done using voice activated system. If the computer continues working as is, I will be very happy with my $404 purchase."
5.0,Easy to Use,Nice screen quality and easy to use!
5.0,Nice machine for the price,"Laptop is great for the purpose for which I purchased it. Starts up quickly. Battery life seems adequate so far. Don't set your expectations high on screen quality with this machine. Resolution makes a difference, so just keep this in mind when evaluating your options.  Overall, nice machine for the price."
4.0,Very good laptop for the money,Very good laptop for the money. For just surfing and basic activities this is a reasonable one.

5.0,"que llegue lo que uno encargo, entiempo y forma","todo perfecto, llego lo que encargue a tiempo ."
2.0,Tiny.,"I knew a 14"" laptop was going to be small, but dang. Wasn't prepared for how small the screen and the keyboard would be."
5.0,Definitely wroth the price!!!,If your looking for a laptop that’s not a Mac book with a good price this is the one. I purchased laptops from amazon and after a couple weeks it stopped working but with this laptop it’s  light weight brand new you and I had no problems so far so good you won’t regret it.

3.0,The 128GB M.2 is not upgradeable to larger SSD because the HDD cable/adapter is not available,"It's a decent budget laptop but I've only used it for a few days. My big disappointment is that the hard drive cable (part # L23187-001) is not currently available so I don't see a way to upgrade the M.2 to a higher-capacity ""regular"" and more affordable SSD."
