1.0,"The computer is slow, hard to navigate, and intent on selling its on products and apps.","I wish I'd taken more time to do a little comparison shopping.  This laptop, although light as a feather and having a nice keyboard, basically does everything it can to pull you toward its products, constantly undercutting your work with ""suggestions.""  It also steers you away from anything that Microsoft doesn't own or control.  And it's very unresponsive.  I really hate this computer.  Update:  I've had the laptop for about a month now, and can add that it now makes a distracting humming sound to go along with its other issues."
5.0,Much Faster if upgrade the ram and switch to ssd,"I bought the basic configuration. My friend is a tech savvy and helped me upgrade the RAM from 4GB to 8GB and replace the 500GB HDD to 256 GB SSD. The laptop runs significantly faster than when i received it. It can run more than 10 tabs at the same time under Google Chrome web browser. Remember to update windows before installing any softwares; remove bloatwares when replacing the hd to ssd and clean install the windows 10. Mine comes with windows 10 S (New from Microsoft), do not like it. You can switch to regular windows 10 by turning off the S mode: 1. Press the Start button located at the bottom left of your screen; 2. Select the Settings icon, located just above the power icon on the Start menu; 3. Select Update & Security in the Settings app; 4. Select Activation, and then select Go to Store; 5. Select the ""Get"" option under ""Switch out of S mode""; 6. Then hit Install when ready to proceed. 7. The process to switch out of S mode is seconds (maybe about five to be exact). You do not need to restart the PC for it to take effect. You can just continue on and start installing .exe apps now in addition to apps from the Microsoft Store."
1.0,Do Not BUY!!,"This laptop is not worth the money at all! My laptop is defective and keeps freezing and lags like it was made in the 1990's! I cant watch a video, cant work on homework and anything else. I have to wait on it for a while to do anything! What is the point of the laptop if its not making my life easier! I thought it would be good to buy due to the price point but i am now returning it because it is not worth it and its a failure!"
1.0,May just need the o.s reloaded.,"Would not connect to internet about half the time, if that. Keeps getting a start menu error. Returning it."
4.0,Good Inexpensive Laptop,I wanted an inexpensice basic Laptop.  There are better out there but for a lot more money.  You can't find a better laptop top at this price.  It does exactly what I need it to do.
4.0,Great laptop for my 15yr old grandsons homework.,Worked as advertised.  Arrived promptly on time. Upgraded to 8G of memory and 1TB of disk storage.
4.0,Good laptop for the money,Works fine for a backup computer. Didn't like that you pay a base price then have to buy storage space.
4.0,Good but not great,"Works as it should, a bit slow on opening files and apps though. But not bad for the price. If you’re looking for something high performing I probably wouldn’t recommend this one but for a teen needing to write papers or even a college student ms office suite works and so does Netflix/Hulu. So there’s that"
5.0,Great lap top,The advantage to be able to pick how much RAM and size of drive was great
5.0,Decent laptop for home use,Great price. Delivered fast. Surprised to find hard drive was free upgraded to 1TB. Good quality for the laptop under $300. Recommended.
