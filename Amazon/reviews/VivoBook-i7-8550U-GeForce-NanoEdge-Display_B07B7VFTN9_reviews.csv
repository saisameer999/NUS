4.0,Good for the Price!,"I don’t write very many reviews but when spending quite a bit of money on something, I do like to try and give a good, unbiased opinion on it. I am very familiar with technology and computers as I build desktop PCs for personal and business use but I’m not quite as familiar with the world of laptops. I will try and hit each important category but they will be no particular order. First off, I would like to describe exactly what I was looking for."
4.0,Good laptop for students: Lightweight and powerful enough,I've had this laptop for a month now and it works great. It's nice and lightweight and easy to carry around on campus. I use it mainly for school and a little gaming on the side when I'm not at home. Don't expect to be playing on high settings. I only play League of Legends and Fortnite on it and it runs fine on medium or low settings. The charger is nice and light and the whole laptop is macbook-esque from the design to the charger. The only thing I wish they took from the macbook charger was the prongs to coil the wire around and the power prongs to fold in. The battery life is alright. I've used it for a whole 3 hour class and was left at 80% and charge it every other day.
5.0,Prime day deal,"Bought this on prime day for 100.00 dollars off I’ve been in desperate need of a laptop so I jumped on this deal almost immediately, I like the size very light and small but still a good size screen at 14 inches, very fast takes seconds to start up and so far all programs run fast, fluid, and smooth. I usually only game on my consoles PlayStation or Xbox but wanted to try out the power of this pc just for fun and it ran fortnite pretty good not great but good. This is my first week so I will update review through out the year to let you know how it handles on basic wear and tear of use."
4.0,Fantastic performance for the price!,"I've only had the product for a few days but I can already tell this purchase was well worth. Laptop is super light, boots quickly, and so far has handled everything I've thrown at it including some light gaming. Also received the computer and its color is not as gold as I thought it would be from the pictures which is a bonus as well."
5.0,"very good product, well done!","very light for 14inch. the combination of ssd and i7 8th core make everything you do on it superfast. I actually tested some very large excel spreadsheet processing on it after i bought it two days ago, and simply amazing, very very fast. the keyboard design is great too. i dont feel my fingers get cramped, with LED backlight very nice. the software that helps extend the longevity of the battery also works great. not too much junk software either. it comes with WPS office suites which is a great alternative to Microsoft office. the charger is small and lightweight too. very trendy look with light gold color. overall, i am extremely pleased by this product! well done!"
4.0,"Good, even great for the price but it's definitely not perfect",Purchased during Prime day for 699 and its a great deal for the specs. Like it a lot. I sold my iPad pro for this one and didnt regret much. Below are the pros and cons of the S410UN and I tried to benchmark it using my 2016 12' Macbook and iPad pro.
2.0,"Great laptop, but better value exists elsewhere","So far this is a pretty great laptop. It's replacing my Asus Zenbook, but I'm not sure the faster processor and bigger screen is that much of an improvement. The battery life seems significantly shorter than the Zenbook and the i7 processor isn't really a noticeable improvement over the i5 for my uses. If you do a lot of gaming or something I'm sure the better processor makes a difference, but if you're a student and do a lot of writing, web research, that sort of multitasking, etc, the i5 is fine. If I had to do it again, I'd probably save a little money and get the newer Zenbook. This is still a great little laptop that works fast and smooth, and really quiet so far with very little fan noise. I just thought the bigger screen and faster processor would be worth the extra money (about $50 over the Zenbook, as it's priced right now), but the added weight and shorter battery life essentially make it a wash."
5.0,Great small laptop,"I've had several laptops so far. The first ones were ""desktop replacements"". Great for power but heavy and next to nothing on battery life."
5.0,Love the Asus Vivo--Boots up in 10 seconds,"Love the Asus Vivo--Boots up in 10 seconds....Lightning fast...Color is great...Speakers very good...very light …only minus is there doesn't seem to be an indicator light when the ""caps lock"" is activated.  I give it a 5 rating...."
1.0,Do NOT buy this computer if the WARRANTY is a selling point for you!!,THREE RMAs. SAME PROBLEM. STILL NOT FIXED!!!
1.0,Died after 4 months,"I had this computer for 4 months and it completely crashed out of the blue one day. I work from home, never really move my computer it sits on my desk but I do use it a lot. It went completely black, no lights, etc. It was a motherboard issue. I understand sometimes computers have faulty parts and that's all fine but I went through Asus support and I will tell you they have the worst customer support I have ever dealt with (and I've had Time Warner Cable before so that says something)."
3.0,GLITCHY laptop,"I wish this laptop came exactly as it promises. What I've received is a glitchy laptop. Maybe this is an anomaly, so I've requested a replacement for this laptop. If I no longer encounter the glitches (stated below) in the replacement laptop, I will update this review."
4.0,Bad music production and DJ experience.,"Everything about this laptop is perfect unless your using this for music production or DJing. I really liked that laptop but when I run fruity loops studio or rekordbox, I would get static/distortion. The amount is minimal but there shouldn't be any at all for a powerful laptop. I tried everything from updating drivers, changing the buffering, and reinstall. All my music sounds like it's being played thru VNYL records with some minor distortion. If your using this laptop for anything other than DJing or music production, it is the best laptop available."
4.0,"Good computer, however battery die in 2 weeks","I really like Asus, the products are not cheap and  I used all the time, however, the new ASUS VivoBook S Thin & Light Laptop, 14"" FHD, Intel Core i7-8550..  I paid extra for two day shipment,  however, i am  disappoint,, first  power cord stop working in roughly less than 10 days, computer is okay  but unable.  what is ASUS quality ?"
5.0,Awesome,For the money I have no complaints. I wanted a laptop to do all my everyday basic tasks with no lag and  it does a decent job running csgo when I feel the need to kill some s*!t
5.0,"Read a little further to see what you are getting for an extra $100, BEFORE you order!","I returned an  ASUS ZenBook 13 Ultra-Slim Laptop, even though it was a very good computer, HOWEVER, this ASUS VivoBook S Thin & Light 14"" Laptop IS EVEN BETTER, and well worth the extra $100 it cost me.  I don't think I will be returning THIS VivoBook - never!!!  Thanks for a super nice & great performing laptop..."
5.0,Get if you enjoy a loud fan,"Seems like okay laptop,  feels cheap quality build for the price.  The only thing that bugs me is that if you run anything more demanding than netflix, then the fan will be LOUD, and the bottom heats up really quick."
4.0,Great Value!,Great Value!
1.0,Track pad is junk .... not worth the Money,"i got this on Sep 30  2018 , on Nov 22nd 2018 the track pad stopped working ."
1.0,I HATE THIS LAPTOP. Problem after problem.,"it's constantly disconnecting from the wifi, and often disables the wifi adapter on its own so I have to troubleshoot to fix it. Half the time troubleshooting doesn't work, and I lose whatever I was working on. It often takes 3 mins to restart the laptop as well, which seems strange to me."
5.0,Five Stars,"Great speed, very light, has all the bells and whistles, except for CD drive."
1.0,Brand new and already off to be repaired,"I bought this for college. 1/2 way through the first semester the battery looks to have died (according to Amazon tech help). I've had it a few months and it's already sent off to be repaired. That is absurd and beyond unacceptable. I need this for class and I'll be lucky if I can get it back within 10 business days. Amazon has been great, but i'll not be recommending Asus anytime soon."
1.0,Not worth the money you spend.,"I usually buy cheaper laptops, and this was the one time I actually spent decent money to treat myself. BIG mistake. Sound quality is poor, tracker pad BARELY works. I've only had this thing for a few months and have been very careful with it (as I've actually spent decent money on it) and it's breaking down faster than anything I've used before. Most expensive laptop I've bought, and the WORST by far."
3.0,"Good functionality, poor build","The first thing I noticed upon startup is that there is heavy discoloration all the way around the bezel whenever there is a black screen. The type of discoloration you see when you poke an LCD screen. It is not noticeable any time other than a black screen, but it is extremely distracting when watching darker videos. It appears to be caused by too much pressure around edges of the LCD. Hard to see from the photos due to the limitations of photographing an LCD screen, but you can see it in the bottom right-hand corner as well as the left side of the screen. This discoloration goes all the way around the screen but can't be seen in the photos due to reflection."
4.0,Great hardware for the price but crappy Windows 10,+good trackpad and actually recognizes gestures
4.0,Excellent Laptop with Minor Shortcomings,"I bought this laptop used on Amazon as ""Used -  Acceptable"" and it came in great condition. The scratches on the top could only really be seen at a certain angle in the light. A wrap/skin could just cover this up no problem (which is what I did)."
4.0,Worthy Laptop,"I have just a few complaints about this Laptop, but keep in mind the same comparable Laptop online will cost you $200 dollars more."
1.0,battery problem,screen quality seems pretty good. But battery hasn't worked like on and off after just several months. Screws attached started falling off just after 2 months....so cheaply made. So regret buying this for my kid who really wanted a good gaming laptop!
1.0,Terrible Sound,I would never purchase this product again. The speakers are TERRIBLE. Other than that its a good computer. But I am not joking when I say the sounds is just TERRIBLE
4.0,Good laptop with a few problems,Pros
4.0,Great buy for the price.,"Great laptop.  I have owned this one for about 6 weeks and so far I love it.  It is small and light, but the screen seems quite large.  Only took a couple hours for all the updates to run and was very easy to set up. There was not a lot of junk that had to be deleted. I think Google Chrome helped because I just put in my password and all my info was there.  So fast to boot and close down. SSD is great. Few minor things that keep this a from being a 5-star laptop.  The finger reader is very picky.  Usually requires 3 or more attempts.  Nice when it works but a bit awkward. The touchpad is not really as responsive as I would like.  I use a Bluetooth mouse so not a big problem.  As someone else mentioned, the Caps Lock does not have any indicator on the keyboard or the screen to let you know if it is on or off. If these three minor items were improved, this would be a 5-star plus machine. For now, I give it 4.5 stars."
3.0,"Runs small tasks smoothly, but overheats fast and some connection issues","The laptop is nice aesthetically. It performs many of the tasks I want it to do- writing documents, watching movies, lounging on the internet."
2.0,Battery failed in a week,It's great  to look at. Nice and light. Runs well. No issues with the temperature if when used intensively.
2.0,Some annoying features still bother after a year,"So I got this laptop a year ago, and there are things that I thought I would get used to in time. Well, I didn't and I just gotta say I wish I'd returned this laptop. Sure its light weight, and streamlined enough... but the delete button is right next to the power key, and they are both half sized keys. THE NUMBER OF TIMES I HAVE TURNED MY LAPTOP OFF WHEN WRITING IS RIDICULOUS. It really is. I probably turn it off every other week by misclicking. It is the worst design."
1.0,Laptop is faulty,Backlight keyboard stopped working a month in. Laptops brightness constantly changed when I’m using it for some reason. Finger print scanner rarely works. Asus’s support line doesn’t answer the first few times. The touchpad stopped working properly after a while and the laptop doesn’t close all the way either.
3.0,Touchpad and Hinge issues,"I've had this laptop for about 8 months now, and overall I do like it; I am a full-time college student and use it nearly everyday. However, I have 3 main complaints:"
2.0,Problems straight out of the box,"This laptop looks beautiful, sleek, light weight, and appeared to power on in a flash .... however straight out of the box it gave me ""battery not detected"" error and wouldnt power on unless plugged into a power outlet. After calling Amazon, they determined I could either keep it for a 25% discount or return it for a full refund. I need to be able to use it on the go for graduate school so I returned it. Ill be choosing another brand of laptop next time."
4.0,"Amazing speeds, but battery life is just ok, and hinge isn't great","I love this laptop. It's incredibly fast for basic web-browsing and great for light gaming thanks to the MX150. Adobe CC has always been my mortal enemy because of how agonizingly laggy most of its apps are on my past laptop, but the VivoBook opens and runs the Adobe CC apps I use just fine. I've noticed some stuttering here and there for heavier processes, but it's not enough to be a nuisance."
5.0,Loving it so far,"I've had this laptop for about 3 months now, and so far it's great."
4.0,Good quality so far,"I needed a relatively cheap laptop to use for astrophotography - capturing images out in the field at night in cold and humidity. So far, it has worked very well. One cool and dewy evening the trackpad became unresponsive, when the humidity was too high, but I probably shouldn't have been using it under those conditions. (I've since started putting it inside a box to trap some of the ambient heat and keep the dew off it.) It's lightweight and feels a little flimsy, but if you treat it with respect and care, it should hold up. I liked that the 8550U has three USB ports and one  micro USB-C port. I have the computer controlling my camera, autoguider, and telescope mount at the same time, and there's never been a hiccup. The processor is fast and crunches the data quickly, too. Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,Amazing laptop!,Amazed for $700 getting 2gb of gddr5 in a mx150 graphics card. Extremely light laptop. Boots amazingly fast as any new laptop should. I've had this for about 6weeks now. No complaints other than I have a dashcam that I like to transfer videos to my laptop through a micro sd card. The sd card slot on this laptop doesnt allow the sd card to be fully inserted. I usually leave a micro sd to full size sd reader in my laptop but cant with this laptop as it half sticks out. But that's ni problem for the quality and price of this!
2.0,Hard drive failed after 1.5 months,"Let me preface this review by stating that I opted to purchase a ""Used - Like New"" version of this laptop, which was both fulfilled and inspected by Amazon."
4.0,"Good, very light, but not perfect","I needed a **very light** laptop to take on vacations, to conferences, etc.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I paired it with a very light laptop bag I found on amazon.  (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MRTV154/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  the 13 inch version fits perfectly, despite this saying it's a larger size)."
5.0,great laptop that's packing some power.,"I was looking for a laptop for school and personal use. I wanted to spend a decent amount of money for a good product. I wanted something that can provide the essential power and performance. I just started my computer programming class C++, so I needed something that can run visual studio for basic coding. Also, running MS office with words, excel, and access daily as well . I spent a lot of hours watching videos, reading reviews, and comparing several laptop before I decided that this was the best choice."
4.0,Very light with great performance.,"Very good laptop. It’s looks really sleek and is very light. It’s been able to perform well so far with a few word, excel and statistical packages software without any hitch. It’s runs very quiet and the fan comes on like once or twice during my work. The batter life isn’t that good. I get an average of 4.5 hours with consistent use. There are a lot of light leakage under the keys and with mine.. the trackpad is kind of loose and makes a clicking sound with just the slightest touch which makes it seems like there is something loose under it. The speakers aren’t that great so I connected it to my Bluetooth speaker. But for what I got it for it will serve its purpose and I’m happy with that."
2.0,I had some problems with the battery and touchpad,"I wanted a small  and not very expensive computer for (work) travelling, but not a baby computer. This war near that."
1.0,Brand New Computer for $900 and it has no Battery In it?! Seriously?,"Purchased one of these for my step-daughter for college in December and her sister loved it so much we just bought her one too. Only problem is, it arrived today and when I fired it up, it said on the task bar ""No Battery Detected"". Mind you, it wasn't that the battery was low on power, it was either not in the computer or was in but not connected. And it's not a removable battery, so it's not like I could just pop it out and replace it like you could on older laptop technology. It's integrated into the motherboard so any attempt at replacement would void any warranty.  Even just opening the back to see if it was there would have voided the warranty and prevented me from returning it. How the hell did that get through ASUS Quality Control?!"
4.0,Nice for it's price,"So I was looking for a good, light and cheaper laptop for photoshop."
2.0,Defective,"I ordered this laptop about 2 months ago and I have enjoyed using it a lot. It runs smoothly, does everything I want it to do and it's quite light."
5.0,"Fantastic, Light Laptop","Being a college student this laptop offers everything I could ever need. SSD for the 10 second startup, ram and processor to compute whatever I need, and a graphics card that will tackle light loads."
5.0,Lightning fast,"My first experience with a SSD. Wow for speed. It's easily portable - light weight makes it a dream to pack around. Ordered the soft, zippered enclosure to go with it which makes it easier to handle."
4.0,Best BANG for the buck ultrabook I have ever bought!,"Bought this baby to replace my old dell inspiron. And honestly, this product should be a bit more expensive than this, because this is purely a steal."
2.0,Yellowish Tint on left side,"First things first, this is a beautiful laptop. I was a little skeptical about the gold finish but it has a nice sleek modern look to it. It's super light weight compared to my 2011 15.6 Toshiba that weights about 8 pounds more. The laptop is extremely fast and easy to set up. The biggest issue with mines is this yellowish tint only on the left hand side. I noticed it later on in the day and it's something that I can't ignore. It only shows on dark black images. If I press the screen I can manipulate it on any area of the screen. When there isn't a dark screen you can not see it at all.  I am having problems finding solutions to fix it so I'm hoping it just a faulty error. I'm worried about the durability of this laptop in the future. I have never owned a Asus product and was worried at first. Well post a update on what's going on."
5.0,2018 Asus Vivobook S,"Slim, portable, light-weight, and simple to use. I highly recommend this computer if you are in significant need."
3.0,Not worth it.... go for DELL or HP.,Its just Ok. Nothing great about this product. I bought this product thinking the SSD with 8GB RAM would run faster and smoother. But the fan started making noise right from day 2. It gets heated up very quickly and if playing netflix or youtube then forget about . It evens hangs in the middle and the curser will make you go nuts. Fingerprint detection works hardly. I think we get a better product from dell or HP at the same price which we can rely on. Sorry ASUS... Never coming back to ASUS. I had this product for 3 weeks and thinking it will improve and i fed up with it and returned.
5.0,Cost + Performance = A+++,this is my 3rd Asus laptop and I will continue buying their products.
4.0,Nice laptop,"This laptop is great. It's thin, lightweight, and boots super fast (less than a few seconds and you are in the login screen). It can do everyday things with no issue whatsoever. In terms of performance, I can play 2018 games like Jurassic World Evolution and Shadow of the Tomb Raider with no issues, although I have to lower the graphical setting to medium/low to get a pleasant frame rate. The only con I have is the speakers, the maximum volume is kind of low. I sometimes use headphones or hook it up to a TV so it's not a big deal personally."
2.0,Great Potential. Serious Letdown,This was the perfect laptop for me and AMZ was even great to extend payment for me. It was a no brainer.
4.0,"Would recommend highly. A few cons, but nothing bad.","This is the best laptop I could find for the price, and it really holds up. Easily worth $1,300 (in case there is a price change in the future, I got mine for $800). All-around fantastic with no glaring problems."
5.0,A great economically priced ultrabook,"I have two ultrabooks now, including an ACER S7.  This is slightly heavier, but the keyboard is MUCH better, easier to use and can be seen in low light environments.  It is a 8th generation Intel I7 processor.  The system is surprisingly fast.  And ASUS has an initial setup for Windows 10 that is excellent, with a female voice talking the user through the initial process.  Not as thin as those costing twice as much, but only by a hair.  Highly recommended."
4.0,Very good for the price ($700 Black Friday sale),Pros:
1.0,One Star for Looks,"This is a really good-looking laptop, it’s light and fast enough. This is unfortunately not everything. The fan is loud, even while browsing Wikipedia and other basic sites. There’s a low coil whine every time I scroll. I asked for a replacement and it had the same problem, with the addition of overheating. The battery might be the worst part; it will be at 100% charge and provide less than 2 hours of power, all the while changing its mind on the display about how much time it has left. The replacement’s battery drained suddenly just from watching a video on YouTube! Had to call Asus twice and nothing could fix the problems."
5.0,Fantastically Good Laptop,"This laptop is the perfect balance of price, speed, storage and size. Compared to some laptops I have had that I would say are comparable to this, it easily beats them and at half the price. Gaming is a breeze, graphics are excellent and streaming/downloading content is flawless. If you want a top end laptop without spending over a thousand dollars you better buy this laptop."
5.0,Boots up fast.,I haven't been able to do a whole lot with it yet but everything I've done has been quick. Just using for the first time not plugged in today and 7 hours remaining after an hour of use. Nice.
5.0,Great portable platform!,"Upon booting it up I was scared. I haven't had a computer of my own since... 2010. Apparently erroneous 10 takes forever to do initial boot. Afterwards PC usage of installing programs of many GB went surprisingly fast. Thank you SSD and I7. I had my doubts with it being so small, but it was way better than anticipated."
1.0,"Worked great, until it stopped working.","3 months after buying it and it won't turn on. Currently waiting in a queue to talk to a Asus support. Would try and fix it myself, but that risks voiding the warranty. Decidedly unimpressed."
3.0,FAIR UNBAISED REVIEW..,Pros:-  a) Decent look..
5.0,"Like it, very worth the money","Arrived very quickly, surprising since I live in Hawaii."
2.0,Not real thrilled.,"When I recieved this laptop the first thing I noticed was what looked like a line down the top of the metal cover...maybe it was damaged while being manufactured. Either way it definitely looks messed up. When I tried to set this laptop up I noticed there were a number of apps, services etc that were expired on it like the McAfee free trial, Asus giftbox and a few other things. And now one more problem. The audio is awful. I have to push it up past 75 to be able to listen to music or anything. At 100% it still very low. Im am seriously disappointed with this $854 laptop."
3.0,Keyboard Malfunctioned within 2 months,"They keyboard stopped working after only a couple of months. Had to pay shipping (only $15), but am out of a computer for a few weeks. ASUS was good at getting the RMA done and maybe its just an isolated incident but annoying nonetheless"
2.0,Product completely froze on me,"I love this PC when it is working. It is smooth and sexy looking, works amazingly fast. Super light and boots up incredibly fast. The trackpad is kinda wired sometimes but it is not a huge issue, it too is also very nice and easy to use. The problem is that the PC completely froze on me and I had to send to to ASUS for repair. I had only used it for 2 weeks. I am a student and the week it broke on me, I had to use my phone to take notes. If I pay 700 some dollars for a product I dont think it should break with in the first 2 weeks."
2.0,Bad network card,"The laptop is good and all but for some reason, My WIFI stop working every 15 mins. It still says its connected so I have to disconnect and reconnect and it happens again. I did not have this problem with my previous MacBook. Otherwise, this laptop is pretty decent. This normally happens in multiplayer games."
2.0,"I wanted to love it, but I don't",Pro's:
5.0,For a Compact Computer it awesome,"After using an 11 year old laptop this one is perfect. I was concerned that I would be sacrificing by going to a 14"" from a 17"" but I was wrong. The graphics and screen work great for on the road usage and at home I have a 24"" and it the graphic card gives me great clear images for picture editing. Battery life great. The only concerns are no 10 key and the brushed steel does scratch easily."
1.0,Terrible and glitchy,"Wifi signal keeps dropping. Doesn't matter what router or modem I use, its all the same."
5.0,Super fast and extremely light,I was in the computer software business for 35 years and have been through many HP and Dell machines that were very good but the ASUS machine is by far the finest machine I have ever owned. I couldn't be happier and if you travel to any extent it is a must.
1.0,They don't let you rate it ZERO so ONE,Flimsy design and it died.
3.0,Feels like a toy,I have been using an Acer Swift 3 for the past year. This laptop feels like a toy in comparison. Although its fast AF and plays D3 and WoW at 60 fps @ 1080p med settings. It can compile huge spreadsheets faster than a speeding bullet so its worth the flimsy feel... for now...
5.0,I am so in love with this little one.,I haven't test her power since I'm a bit away from civilization but I hope to test her abilities with design programs and games to update this review.
1.0,Does not work with Ubuntu!!!,Does not work with Ubuntu!!!
1.0,Do not buy,"Buying this laptop is going to be a waste of your time. It's not good at all when it comes to speed, graphics or resolution."
5.0,Better than I was expected,"When I first read about the technical review on this round, I thought it was a lie because of the cost, then I started reading more about it and I realized that it was what I needed. I bought it for $ 699 and the fact that I had it in my hands and tried the quality, really ... better than I expected."
5.0,Good specs for cost,I got it for $699 as part of thanksgiving day.
4.0,Great Small Laptop for on the Go,"Asus did not disappoint with the VivoBook S Thin & Light Laptop. Small form factor, compact slim design, upgrade-able memory, expandable HD and a back-lit keyboard as well. It has been running fine so far, no major sticking points or malfunctions. WIFI signal has been consistent with no drops noticed. Overall a good buy. Wish there were cover cases for this model on the market."
5.0,Exactly what I wanted!,This was a Christmas gift from my husband and I absolutely love it! It’s lightweight and quiet. The battery life is awesome I don’t need to plug it in every 2 seconds. No complaints!!
4.0,"Good, mid priced laptop!","Bought this on prime day, and I am thoroughly pleased with it! Not a lot of junk ware (although there is some!).  Good product for simple email, web surfing, social media, and documents.  I probably would not use this for much else.  The build seems sturdy enough, and the battery last us a few days with light use every day.  I would recommend and I would buy again!"
1.0,The computer did not last a year,Bought the computer in July 2018 and it is dead in less than a year I’ve replaced the battery still dead and yes the charger shows voltage I will never buy another Asus computer again
4.0,Touchpad issues,"Fast, sturdy, powerful laptop. Only issue noticed is the touch pad which intermittently decides to stop responding for about 30 seconds, then works again on it's own. Updated drivers did not fix this issue. Not sure if this was just mine or a problem for everyone."
5.0,So worth the cost!!!,"My 16 year old wanted this to play her games on, especially Sims. She actually got a job just to purchase it. She told me it does everything she needs and absolutely loves it!"
5.0,Recommendable,"It is a really a very good laptop. Fast, light, very nice looking. In comparison to similar devices I recommend this because it has same features with the cheapest price."
5.0,Fast and Portable,"As a college laptop for an engineering student it works perfectly. This laptop runs programs as Netbeans, Python, Arduino, Inventor, Autocad (the ones that i use) without any problem. Sometimes it gets really hot while playing Fortnite, but afterall is not a gaming laptop. The feature i love the most is the fact that is so easy to carry that ot feels like im not eveb taking my laptop in my backpack. Another negative point is that 256gb ssd is not enough, but you are able to expand this laptop ssd or hdd also."
5.0,Unbeatable for the price,"Really nice laptop, even better when seen from the price point. It's even better than my friends' laptops that are $1000+. It covered all of my wants. My singular complaint would be that it could have a slightly better battery life, but that's usually not an issue. It typically last for 5-6 hours for me."
2.0,"Good laptop but beware after 4 months of light use, the battery is dead....","Terrible service, trying to get a hold of someone is not the greatest experience.  Buyer beware"
5.0,Excellent College and Program Heavy Work Laptop,"Can run eight programs at once without any issues. Had issues in the past with ""college friendly"" laptops. Those failed when it came to trying to stream anything. Also this laptop has the WIFI technology to connect to all levels of the US wide college WIFI  system EDUROAM, which the other laptops were not able to do."
1.0,Not the best investment,"Possibly the worst laptop I’ve ever purchased. It works really well the first month or so, then the physical quality (more specifically the screen / display) diminishes quickly."
4.0,"The computer works great, its super lightweight and perfect for school","I received the laptop on 6/18/18, when it came the box was damaged on one of the corners. I opened it expecting to see a case included, on similiar to all the youtube videos I watched but it was not included. The computer works great, its super lightweight and perfect for school. Im only giving it 4 stars due to the fingerprint scanner does not work. I reached out to Amazon and they replied within 2 hours and fixed this issue. I recommend this laptop. Its unfortunate the fingerprint scanner didn't work tho."
5.0,Great laptop at great price!,Battery life is great and laptop is fast! Came as described!
4.0,Excellent!!!,Easy to use light weight notebook. Came packaged really well (seal intact) I must say it's a great buy.
5.0,Awesome laptop!!!,Great laptop! Best feature is how fast it starts up. I've never had any issues with it and I use a few hours everyday. The only draw back that I have is the color which really doesn't matter at all. I highly recommend.
1.0,The HDMI connection stops working every two months,Then you have to send for repair and it happens again and again and again and again
5.0,So far so good,Have only had it for a few hours now... and so far everything is going great. This little thing is lightening fast.... boots up in about 3-4 seconds.
5.0,perfect laptop if you are a student,IM a student and it is the perfect laptop for me. its super light and very fast.
2.0,Very average,Build quality is poor.
5.0,Amazing computer,The only con is that the material is plastic instead of metal for the covers. However this makes it super light weight. I cant tell you how much better it is to have to move this when it weights so little. Fast and good battery life
1.0,Faulty,Don’t waste your time with it... the mouse pad doesn’t work properly plus the function keys don’t work either...
5.0,Great laptop!,Loved the size and light weight.
5.0,Powerhouse for the price,"Very nice compact and lightweight laptop. Very attractive, excellent specs. Hard to beat at this price."
1.0,Very bad quality,Very bad quality
4.0,Good lightweight laptop. Had one battery problem,"Laptop is very good, especially as a student. Had a battery malfunction 6 months in and it took a month to get it fixed but this is party due to a fault of mine. Overall, a good product"
5.0,Great laptop,"Great product! I use this mainly for college stuff (word, PowerPoint, etc.) but I also use it for the Sims 4 and Overwatch. They both run great on it. The keyboard area is a little flimsy but it’s no big deal as long as you don’t put a crazy amount of pressure on it. I’m VERY satisfied with this purchase!"
5.0,I would recommend it,Consistently high performance since I bought it 3 months ago.
5.0,Great light laptop for the price,"Great extremely light lap top. Does my work, email with good processing speed."
4.0,A wise choice,"Had this laptop for about 6 months now and I have no complaints. It stays cool to the touch and is SUPER quiet; the only time I hear the fan is when I'm working and have to plug it up via the adapter (and even then, the noise is light)."
5.0,La pantalla para ver videosy jugar es genial,"Perfecta para la oficina. Es rapida y es muy liviana, hasta para tenerla en casa es genial. La pantalla de la laptop se ve genial. Recomendada 100%"
5.0,"Great Laptop, Very light and small","Great so far, packs a punch for the size of it."
5.0,Great little laptop so Far.,Works as expected without any hassles. Very quick boot up and shut down. Also added an SSD to empty bay inside to expand storage space another 1tb. Will buy again or similar if I need to replace in the future. Only draw back is power cord is a bit short but battery life outweighs that.
4.0,The touch pad freezes,The touch pad freezes occasionally from the first month of purchasing. I need the laptop and I cannot afford staying without it while it is shipped to maintenance so I am using a USB mouse.
5.0,Best Laptop Ever,"Is really thin, lightweight and has a very stylish look, the color is not so gold, is more like in between gold and silver so it looks great on a man or woman. Battery life is incredibly amazing! Performance is even better than expected!"
5.0,Lightweight Great Performance,This is very lightweight.  I was shocked when I picked it up.  The color on the screen is fantastic. It has an intel i7 which is very fast in comparison to most chips currently out there.
4.0,Four Stars,sad that the caps key is not lit when its locked
5.0,Very fast start up,"Super fast, portable very lite and good battery life"
5.0,fast and easy to use,"So far, love it!  Laptop works super great - fast and easy to use.  Perfect!"
5.0,Just don't buy it for the display,Light bleed in on dark screens and color accuracy a bit off though adjustable. Other than that it's a superb deal for an all rounded laptop. Very happy with this lightweight powerhouse.
1.0,The battery is not charging,What is going on?
5.0,The little big Asus,Great performance.
5.0,A good product!!!,A good product. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. Thanks!
5.0,"Light, thin and fast!!",Took a chance and ordered the open box version. Showed up in perfect condition. Its very quick. I clocked the start up tome at 9.6 seconds.  Impressive.
3.0,Internal Speakers - sub par,Its a nice laptop. I do have concerns of the durability because how light and thin this is. The internal speakers are horrible. You need to have the sound full max to hear anything. An external speaker or blue tooth speaker is a must if you buy this notebook.
5.0,Asus notebooks are excelent,I am an Asus notebook fan for many years. Keep it up
5.0,Exactly As Represented,"Very nice, on time delivery, runs as expected. I am happy."
3.0,Very Very bad Camera...,"Slim, light weighted.. portable.. works good...."

5.0,Blazing fast startup.,"I bought it to run Lightroom and photoshop when I’m away from my desktop. Runs almost as good as my desktop, very happy with it."
5.0,awesome laptop,"best laptop i ever bought, fast, light, happy i bought this, 5 star all the way"
4.0,Possible spotty WiFi,Idk if it’s just me but the WiFi is so spotty??? Everywhere I go it seems... other than that I literally love this laptop like it’s my child.
4.0,Four Stars,Nice computer for the price.
