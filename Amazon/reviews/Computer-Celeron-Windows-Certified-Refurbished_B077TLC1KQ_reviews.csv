5.0,"It is a beautiful laptop, arrived in perfect (refurbished but couldn't tell) ...","It is a beautiful laptop, arrived in perfect (refurbished but couldn't tell) condition. it boots up very fast, and runs in perfect condition. I can play games and do all my paper work. Surprisingly, even I opened multiple tabs and browsers, it still response very fast, no delay at all, doing much better job than my desktop (though it is old, but has i5 in it)."
4.0,"As a computer, it is okay, no complains ...","As a computer, it is okay, no complains about that. But be aware that it has no space to save almost anything in the hard disk, so  when buying it don't forget to buy as well an SD card of at least 2GB to store your stuff."
3.0,Meh...it's just okay.,"It's okay. That's really it. It's a cheap, basic computer that's really only good for surfing the internet. I bought it for mainly that purpose and video chat and unfortunately if I do want to use it for video chat I'll have to get an external webcam as this one is crap. I haven't thrown away the box yet because I'm not convinced I'm going to keep it."
1.0,... runs way too slow comes with a bunch of useless apps which take up all the space,It runs way too slow comes with a bunch of useless apps which take up all the space.  You don't know which ones you can delete to get more space because you don't know what they're for.  Plan to return if I can.
5.0,Perfect for me,"I am delighted with this item, my first laptop ever. I was having issues updating but after I researched and implemented solutions updates were installed and I find this device has been a great addition for my needs. I really haven't had time to explore all of it's advantages and offerings and look forward to the discoveries.  Added point: The communication from the seller has been supportive, positive, and didn't feel like just a sales promo."
3.0,Commit time to removing junk.,Not impressed. The system is fast but the vast majority of hard space is filled - we’re getting storage warning after a few days and only installed chrome. Must spend a lot of time setting up and cleaning up.
1.0,"Too sluggish, returned an hour after it was delivered.","The computer was very sluggish. It wouldn't allow me to even create a Google account. It was packed up and returned within the hour. My daughter has this same computer, bought new, and it works just fine for what she needs it for. I'll pay a little extra and go new next time."
2.0,"It may work for a kids first laptop or for grandma to play solitaire, but not much else.","The first thing I noticed about this laptop even when I picked up the box from my porch was just how light it was. The set up was easy, though I was not impressed by Cortana. However, once you completed set up, it just went downhill from there. I had two programs that I wanted to download onto the laptop, got one installed with little issue other than the computer moving super slow because it just isn't able to process information quickly. The other program would not install at all because it simply didn't have enough capacity to handle it. Mind you; these are pretty generic Microsoft Office programs. The laptop gives you a one-year subscription to Office 365, which is their web-based suite. That's fine, but it's only good for a year. (I'm a Mac user, so I was fine with not having Office per say, but this seemed like another I had to wait for the computer to crawl) I spent hours trying different things to make this machine work for me. However, it's basically a flip phone trying to be a smartphone, and it just can't handle it. I imagine that if you had a kid that needed a cheap computer to write papers on, this might work (if you're willing to pay for the office 365 subscription) or you can set it up for granny to play on facebook and solitaire, but it's such a weak machine that it couldn't accomplish much more than that."
1.0,"Slow as hell, didn't do anything I needed it to.","I bought this piece of crap to replace my other Windows10 laptop because the other one I have sucks and is really damn laggy. It was a waste of money. I set up the PC and went to install chrome. It wouldn't let me because apparently this computer only installs windows store apps, which I'm sure isn't just with this particular computer but it hasn't happened to me before. Had to install something off windows store that disables it, tried to then install chrome again which was a pain in the ass. It took 15 minutes alone with the installation for chrome, and on my other computers, it takes only like 5 minutes. Couldn't do ANYTHING on chrome when I opened it up, I mean it was completely freaking FROZEN. Tried to shut chrome off (which it took like 10 seconds to do, should happen instantly though) and once it did I went to look in the computer's settings to see what I can do to speed it up but it slowed down to crap before I could do so. 1/10 Would not recommend. Big waste of money."
1.0,I expected Better,This has to be the slowest laptop ever. I guess you get what you pay for. I thought since this was an Hp I would receive better quality. But we all know what they say about making assumptions. This system is just aggravating and insulting.  My 5 yr old doesn't like it my phone is faster.
1.0,"Junk, hadn't even used it yet and it locks up","Just got it today, haven't used it yet just going to and it freezes on lock screen. Asking me to update security pin that security settings were changed. I haven't changed a damn thing. didnt even use it yet."
4.0,Not tested well enough.,"Bought this for my daughter. I recently found out that she has an issue with it. If the Caps Lock button is pressed the keyboard stops working, even after a restart. Probably why it was traded in by the original owner. Unfortunately, I did not realize it was only a 90 day warranty."
4.0,Its a bit smalller that what I expected....,"The laptop is much smaller than I expected more like a 12"", the color I received was grey.  It has 3 outputs for flash drives but all are on the same side together. It's a cute slim fit laptop and it fits in your backpack very comfy that you wouldn't even know that it's there.  The laptop is short on memory but runs really fine, the touch pad is very sharp(responds quickly) and the volume is super. Although the laptop is smaller and shorter on memory other than that its a nice cute laptop."
1.0,Do not BUY!!,This product comes across has a laptop PC but this is more of a chrome book!  There is really no power except to surf and watch videos!  I was very disappointed with this purchase and will never buy  one again!! Really disappointing!
1.0,Motherboard died a week after getting it...,"This was not what was advertised. After receiving the laptop, the device worked slowly and required repeated rebooting and drive cleanings to function. After a week it suddenly wouldn't turn on. After verifying it wasn't a power cord issue, I had a computer technician inspect the laptop and he said it was a faulty motherboard and the computer basically wasn't worth fixing. Would not recommend."
1.0,Should have passed,"Very slow! I like how lightweight it is but even with the best internet is slow to the point of a crawl.l, (I have tested this in multiple places).  This is not a computer made for even games made in the late 90s or early 2000s. Out of space out the box without anything downloaded."
1.0,Are you kidding me,Piece of crap.  Not good for me and cannot imagine what I was thinking getting this.
1.0,Drive is too small to update Windows. Zero storage.,"I’m not a tech savvy guy. I would have thought a 32 GB hard drive would be sufficient to run Windows. Wrong. As other reviewers have noted, it’s not even enough space to install updates. This makes no sense to me, so I did a quick search. SSD vs HDD. . This laptop has an SSD rather than an HDD. An SSD requires much more memory to operate Windows than an HDD, but it is allegedly faster. In order to run Windows AND have some storage, the minimum size SSD recommended is 128GB. Obviously, I’m returning it."
3.0,Great for college student,Like the price and quality dislike the hard drive space having difficulty doing updates because of preloaded items
2.0,Lacks enough Hard Drive,Lap top does not even have enough room to down load the basic Microsoft update. Had to buy additional hard drive to get updates.

2.0,It's Ok no memory 😔,It's good for the money with no memory but you get what you pay for
5.0,This is a great value!,"Laptop was in a ""setup"" mode, kind of like a reboot, when I pressed the power button after charging (although it was a full battery upon arrival). The setup and updates that were going after pressing the power button took about 6 minutes, and it has been a charm to work with since."
4.0,Great production for this price,"It works well, light and easy to carry around but does not have much storage"
5.0,Great computer!,Loved the desktop computer. Best bang for the buck! Great price that I bought 2. One for me ang one for a present.
3.0,Mixed feelings,"Cool, inexpensive, portable, lightweight, fast startup, good battery life, ideal laptop for traveling, but literally has no memory for a single update...Then again, it has a memory card slot I should try figuring out to expand its internal memory and solver the memory problem."
1.0,No es lo que esperaba,"El sistema operativo con tiene un buen desempeño para la capacidad del equipo, la tarjeta de vídeo se traba, no trae office y no viene con garantias  de fabrica ni la factura"

3.0,Like others posted,"Like others posted, not enough memory for windows 10, I should have read up more carefully on the specifications.  I'll likely just use it to serf the nest and social media etc."
1.0,How can you guys help me in that way,"Well,the Laptop keep on Freezing"
3.0,Short on memory,"This laptop lacks the memory to do much of anything.  I had to use my thumb drives to offload enough memory so I could update Windows 10. Microsoft states they won't provide updates past April 30, 2018 for this version of Windows 10 and they suggest downloading the updates.  Well, not happening.  I deleted Chrome, all games, any apps not used daily and still not enough memory available.  Thinking strongly of sending this laptop back."

1.0,Do not buy. Does not have room for windows updates.,"Do not buy.  The computer itself is probably fine, but the 32 GB hard drive is so small that I am unable to download and install windows updates, even after deleting some of the stuff that was included.  I imagine it would make a fine Linux machine, but is absolutely unsafe to use as a Windows machine since there is no room for updates."
