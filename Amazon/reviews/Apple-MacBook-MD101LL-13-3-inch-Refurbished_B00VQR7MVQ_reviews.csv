1.0,What a horrible experience.,I purchased 4 of of these laptops.
1.0,Terrible. This is not a refurbished laptop,"Terrible. This is not a refurbished laptop. It is just used. Seller TECHarvard misrepresented this item. The power supply was broken and didn't work. The laptop body is damaged, dents and large scratches. I understand this is a previously owned laptop, but the product description says it will look and work like new. Not even close. I don't know who ""certified"" this refurbishment, but I have a very difficult time believing it was apple. Returning for a refund."
1.0,Just received and doesn't even work Amazon should be ashamed ...,Just received and doesn't even work Amazon should be ashamed  I had a blank screen since I powered it on
1.0,Tried to save some $. Failed.,"Buyer Beware. The first sign that something wasn't right was that this product is not being sold by Apple. I took my chances...tried to save some money. On arrival everything started fine, but definitely seemed pretty slow compared to our previous MacBook Pro. First sign of real trouble came when I downloaded Microsoft Outlook for my work e-mail. The computer couldn't handle it. Spinning beach ball time. Force quit (took a long time)... uninstalled Outlook and things went back to working, but remained slower than a normal Apple. Wife (already skeptical) told me to return it while it was still under Prime return policy. I balked. Held out (again being cheap). Computer worked well enough for about a month that I was OK with it for the cost savings being somewhat slow. Suddenly nothing worked. Literally you would move the trackpad (mouse) and the spinning beach ball would appear. Couldn't even scroll far enough to open a program without the beach ball endlessly spinning. Return policy became a little tricky. Fortunately the product was backed with a 90 day warranty. It took a couple call to Amazon customer service to: A) Return the product B) Get a full refund (they tried to apply a restocking fee). In the end was fully refunded which I appreciate greatly, but would not recommend purchasing."
1.0,Is it stolen?,"Owned and configured by ""Raleigh County School District"""
1.0,If you're expecting a refurbished computer like you would get directly from Apple,"This computer was so beat up, and the charger was FILTHY and split in several areas showing exposed wiring. I didn't even power it up, it went immediately back in the box to return. If you're expecting a refurbished computer like you would get directly from Apple, this is NOT it."
1.0,Advertised product is not the same as what was received. Only worked for 1 month.,Its works okay as expected. I understand that I ordered a refurbished product but it was full of dents and scratches. Letters came off that we had to glue back. The picture that was advertised is not the same as what was delivered. Disappointed at this one.
4.0,"Basically it is an old version, yes. It ...","Basically it is an old version, yes. It doesn't work fast."
1.0,Operating system does not work.,Turned on the computer for the first time and straight to a folder with a question mark. Meaning the operating system was bad. Never got to open iOS once. Mild scratches on the casing. I would recommend buying elsewhere.
1.0,"Hard drive not cleaned, unable to reinstall iOS","Computer was delivered with another administrator set up and much of the hard drive space not cleared. When I cleared the hard drive, I was unable to reinstall iOS and received a ""no bag entry"" error message. So unless you want to risk receiving a laptop with someone else's info on it and no ability to reinstall after cleaning, don't purchase this."
5.0,I am SO happy! I've been reading many review before buying this ...,"I am SO happy! I've been reading many review before buying this refurbished MacBook Pro from this seller, and saw many bad reviews, as well as the good."
1.0,Poor quality for the price,This item was in very rough shape. Outside has been very scratched and damaged. Not listed as being in such used shape. Poor quality for the price.
1.0,has already been returned to the amazon warehouse in USA Product Not recommended.,"Equipment totally defective, use it 02 times and then it did not turn on again. make the return of the product. has already been returned to the amazon warehouse in USA"
4.0,Great investment.,"I was a little bit nervous about purchasing a used/ refurbished MacBook, especially from a third- party seller."
5.0,Honest to goodness deal!,No scratches. Runs smooth. Great price for Macbook Pro Quality! Would buy again.
1.0,Disappointment,"Purchased July 2017 -screen was scratched & keys sticky. Then failed for “no WiFi” hardware..  it’s been out of commission more than working! Purchased the warranty & sent it in for repair, worked for less than a month. “Down”again.  I will NEVER purchase a “refurbished” item again."
2.0,"If you’re desperate, it’s ok. But beware of annoying clothes all the time.","Very sad with this computer. Even though it does work and has somewhat done its part for my job, it’s slow to respond to clicks and opening pages/apps/multiple web tabs. Also, it needs to be plugged in almost all the time. Within 5 minutes, the battery trained 15 minutes off a full charge, and I only had one application open."
1.0,One Star,The product was defective. Old personal file still on the computer. Could not load new software....etc.
2.0,"Scratches, VERY slow, returning soon","My last MacBook was refurbished as well, in perfect condition and ran like new - I guess I got lucky? This one is exactly not that... runs very, very slow. Did not need a password to log into computer but to edit any settings I need the password??? Obviously an older model, which didn't bother me but the outside is pretty noticeably scratched, on top & bottom. Power cord is slightly damaged as well, but works. Definitely going to return"
1.0,Product was marked up and had visible stains on it ...,"Product was marked up and had visible stains on it, also box was opened and didn't have tape on it"
1.0,Wasted my money,"Bought this laptop a year ago and have used it minimally for about 6 months. Several of the keys don't work, and it has some startup quirks -- ie mouse remains frozen for a minute and sometimes  does not engage on selections. Contacted seller who told me to take it to a Mac repair shop. I did. When I dropped it off, they asked if I'd had trouble charging the battery, and were surprised I hadn't because the provided charger was a knock-off! After diagnostics, they said the keyboard needed to be replaced, for over $300 -- Not that much less than what I paid for the thing in the first place. Also, they said it wasn't worth making that kind of investment in a 6-year-old operating system. So -- lesson learned. The name Amazon is not a seal of approval on products from shady outside vendors."
1.0,Defective unit.,Disappointed.  The unit shuts down randomly.  We received someone else's defective laptop.  Returning.
1.0,One Star,The problem was that it had a software issue the laptop never started again
1.0,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! MINE BROKE AFTER 94 DAYS. And there is no way to reach customer service,I wanted to try to resolve this with the seller but there is no way to get in touch with their customer service.
1.0,DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!,MacBook Pro was marked NEW and certified refurbished....... it arrived SCRATCHED ON TOP AND BOTTOM AND COULD NOT HOLD A CHARGE FOR LONGER THAN 2 hours!
1.0,One Star,Continuously shuts down. Numerous errors and issues.
1.0,About 2 months after buying my Mac it started acting ...,"About 2 months after buying my Mac it started acting all off, it wouldn’t charge, it was really slow, took forever to turn on, the keyboard wouldn’t let me type and if it did it would come out in a different language. And right now it has logged me out and won’t let let me log in. So disappointing"
1.0,Not happy.,"Returned it, because it had a scratch when I received it. Plus it was very slow. Didn't arrive as expected."
5.0,Incredible value. Mine appeared brand new other than a ...,Incredible value. Mine appeared brand new other than a few millimeter long scratches on the exterior. He MacBook metal material hides them well. Screen is flawless. Open and closes tightly.
1.0,the computer was in terrible shape. The keys had soda or something in ...,the computer was in terrible shape. The keys had soda or something in them and they stuck. it had dents in the cover and took forever to come on. It was for my daughter and we returned it.
5.0,Great Apple laptop on the cheap! Expect to make upgrades...,"I took a gamble with this purchase I’ll admit, and first and foremost I am not an Apple computer guy, all my standards and pro software i use are on PCs. I specifically bought this on the cheap to have access to Garageband for fun, and its turned out great!!!"
1.0,Poor quality control,"Product works fine, but it had some fairly glaring cosmetic damage. It had a big chip on the back and the charger looked like someone chewed on it. It was also missing the extension to the power cord which isn't terribly bad, but it is still annoying. I chose it because I intended on putting in a solid state and upgrading the device. However, they sent a damaged item originally, so I didn't want to sink more money into the product. Fairly unhappy with the product I received. Would not recommend buying."
1.0,Has some issues. Keeps turning off and I will ...,Has some issues. Keeps turning off and I will have to take it to get it fixed at an apple store.  Too late to return it.
5.0,GOOD BUY,"I bought this for a cousin abroad.  She loves it so far and has no complaints.  Personally, I'm not an Apple user, but I recognize the value for others.  While I did not personally use this computer for any length of time, I did perform a user start-up and a cursory overview just to make sure it was in working order.  As far as I know, there were no problems, certainly not during my interaction.  I consider this a good buy!"
4.0,Good laptop for my intended purposes,"Good laptop for my intended purposes, needed to upgrade to 8 GB RAM for more seamless operation. Overall I'm satisfied."
5.0,Quality exceeding expectation,I was surprised by the quality of this refurbished laptop after the box was opened. It is just like brand new with no sign of wear and tear at all. I am completely satisfied with this purchase.
1.0,I received my macbook and it doesn't even work. ...,"I received my macbook and it doesn't even work. I can't view websites, can't update the OS system, can't download my virus scan, etc. Now I am expected to pay shipping to return my defective device? I wouldn't buy another item from this seller again!"
5.0,Love my refurbished Mac Book Pro and Great Price too!,A little debris on screen. Some minor scuffing to be expected on apple top. Probably laptop bag scuffing. Beautiful machine. I absolutely love my Mac Book Pro. My first one. The operating system was set to default and have had no problems with my refurbished MBP. Audio is great. Graphic resolution is great. And the price...is great too! I would recommend this company to you and my friends. Thank you for a great computer at a great price.
3.0,"Good not great, screen goes scrambled after restarting","I knew I would be getting a rebuilt computer and for most part this does the trick, but it is somewhat slow and unable to REALLY handle the only purpose I got it for, which making music with my seaboard roli.  I'm not an Apple fan really.  Everytime I turn computer back on from rest so far, the screen has gone scrambled (like you drop and broke it), but I restart and it's fine.  If you need this for work or more uses than soley one, spend more money for a better one."
1.0,One Star,It arrived late. Then the screen was shattered. Along with the outside being dented and scratched.
4.0,Just a few scratches and a skin will cover that.,"First I have a tip based on allot of the reviews I read. I always check the prime box and only select items that are fulfilled by Amazon and I have never had an issue. The Macbook Pro came with a few small scratches and a tiny dent in one of the corners but other than that it's like new, works great, and I am quickly adapting to OSX from Windows. I love it. I am going to upgrade the RAM and get an SSD but it's already running perfectly well it just takes a bit too long to boot or open some apps. I am also going to order a skin for it so the scratches and dent will be totally hidden. OSX Mojavie installed flawlessly also. The power cord I recieved with my MacBook is brand new."
1.0,DON'T BUY,"Would give product a Zero if I could. Worked for two startups, then would not turn on. Troubleshot every option, didn't work. Amazon customer service was helpful in returning item, but should stop selling this product."
5.0,Five Stars,I’ve enjoyed using it!
5.0,Great product,Great product
5.0,Exactly as advertised,"Other reviewers have recorded horror stories about getting a machine that was low performing, dirty, etc.  In my case the laptop has a small dent on the back cover, and is otherwise clean and near new looking. The OS is up to date, and the machine performs well.  Therefore an excellent deal compared to buying a new MacBook or buying a pre-owned direct from Apple.  It may be that this is hit-or-miss, or perhaps the refurb source got the message and is doing a better job, I don't know."
1.0,Not worth it.,"This came defective, the Camera would not connect, and it would state that FireVault needed to encrypt the disk. And for 24hrs it kept bouncing between an estimated 6-7 hours to complete, but never does. I needed this for school because I was going on a trip and it was a big fail. Spend your money buying a brand new one instead save yourself the trouble."
1.0,Never again!,"Freezes, the mouse randomly moves itself around making the laptop unusable.  I’ll attempt to have it repaired, but for the price, I should have bought new. Never again!"
1.0,falling apart,"the charger doesn't even work, the cord is falling apart and fraying. the computer is very slow, you can only run one program at a time or it crashes. really peeved about the charger. I hope amazon will replace it. I just bought this computer and I can't afford to replace the charger."
5.0,Skeptical at first,I was worried about buying it but i was fed up with my hp. Im glad i did though! I might as well have thought it was brand new with the packaging it came in! Im completely satisfied
5.0,Five Stars,Perfect for my son's activities
1.0,Hard drive went out within two weeks,Laptop came with scratches but I was able to see past that even though I said refurbished and I haven't even had the computer for more than 2 weeks and the hard drive went out. Took it to the Max store you said I need a new hard drive and for the amount of money I paid for the computer now plus a hard drive I would have been better off buying a brand new laptop
3.0,Goes slowly.  Probably best to upgrade the SSD right away,It is a good basic computer.  Still needs some updates.  Bought it for myself and as a first computer for a college freshman.  Make sure you configure it properly (call Apple tech...they can do it over the phone).  Runs slowly so it would be worth it to upgrade to SSD immediately.
1.0,Total lemon - and DO NOT BUY ASURION WARRANTY,"Laptop totally died 6 months after I bought it.  ""Start up disk broken and can't be repaired""  No problem, I purchased the Asurion 4 year warranty.  Phone number has been disconnected.  Cannot get in touch.  Bad product and worthless warranty."
5.0,Exactly how it should be!,The MacBook Pro I received really looks and works like new. The battery charges properly and has only 200 cycles. An original Apple power adapter was included. Exactly how it should be for a renewed product. Seller: Easymobiledevices.
1.0,Buyer beware,"Buyer beware. I bought this laptop in hopes that it will be in half decent condition. However upon delivery the top was chipped inside was dirty the screen was dirty and it was horrible I don’t know how anyone can present this to a customer. Mind you also for the age of it, it was pretty expensive. I wouldn’t pay 30 bucks for it."
1.0,Computer life Did not last long at all,"I purchased this laptop in February, it stopped working completely in November and I had to get another laptop again. Such a rip off!"
5.0,Exactly what I expected!,"Looked brand new out of the box! Gorgeous computer and runs perfect. Was properly factory reset and upgraded to the latest OS! As described, beautiful! Thank you!"
5.0,Very Happy!,"Pulled it out of the box, plugged it in and it works great!  I have no complaints it looks just as good as new. It’s my first Apple computer so it takes some getting used to but so far I m very happy..  the battery holds a charge for days. The screen is like new..  I’d have no problem recommending this to friends or family."
5.0,Laptop is in like new condition and runs the same,"This laptop is a legend. Still the best seller. Works great as is or you can upgrade to make it easily 2020 compatible.  This is the last laptop that Apple produced that is upgradeable. My battery is a little jacked but that is an easy fix. It is a little hard to believe these really bad reviews about this company. My laptop and experience with this company was and is just fine. If any issues arise, I will post the results."
1.0,Has many problems,Not a refurbished apple MacBook Pro
4.0,"The MacBook Pro is excellent, runs perfectly and I am very satisfied","The MacBook Pro is excellent, runs perfectly and I am very satisfied."
3.0,"So far runs good, but please factory reset these.","Not bad at all so far, system seems to be very responsive. I was scared to buy from these guys because of the terrible reviews but mine is holding out as I speak (might not down the line lol). If you could please send these out factory reseted that would a hell of a lot nicer than going through and doing it yourself and since it is a hassle I wouldve payed more money so you could do it damn. This is my first MacBook so I had no idea how to reset these at all so I called a support and they were very skeptical of me doing this because it appears to them that we are stealing these son of a guns, just please. FACTORY RESET"
5.0,Legacy Apple Laptops Are Still A Value For Students!,Buying this Apple over a new model wan no problem. My 16 year old was extremely happy ever since I bought this computer for her. This her main laptop and was not happy that her High School now forces all students
2.0,Untrustworthy seller...,"The computer at first seemed fantastic, but then it became clear why it was being sold. It will randomly shut down, with no warning, and reboot. It will also randomly crash and go to the login screen, causing loss of data unless you've been very careful to save. Certified refurbished is not up to Apple standards and comes with some serious issues. I am making it work for the price, but I have to be super careful about saving to avoid critical loss of data. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER."
1.0,Horrible choice. Please do not buy this product.,Horrible. Wouldn't refer anyone to buy refurbished products that aren't from apple itself. This laptop was gutted and didnt have apple original hardware. Didnt work well either. Please do not buy from this seller.
5.0,Exactly what I wanted,I prefer the old MacBooks because of their durability and the fact that they have a disc drive. Digitalizing everything is idiotic and short-sighted. This refurbished model works wonderfully and I am much happier with it than the $1200 notebook that can't do anything that I had bought prior to this.
5.0,My favorite. I use this every day and it works ...,"My favorite. I use this every day and it works like it is brand new and looked relatively new. The only downside is that it doesn't have some minor features the newer models have, for instance the camera quality is not the best. I am still thrilled with this purchase though."
2.0,"The company doesn’t return calls, not refurbished","I called the company and got their voicemail, and they never called me back! Some of the keys on the keyboard Stick terribly, making it hard to use, the MacBook Pro typically has certain programs that should come standard, and this unit did not, and it had scratches on it.  Very disappointing as it was a birthday gift for my daughter."
5.0,Very happy with my laptop,"Very happy with my laptop, I did a lot of research and am pleased with this product. There is a small scratch on the top case but it is refurbished and doesn't effect the product at all."
5.0,I've been using it for a year now and it's still running beautifully.,"When I got it, it appeared to be brand new."
1.0,Dirty computer. Not cleaned before resale. Amazon fraud,"I understand it’s used and will have some wear and tear but from the description it makes it sound like it was broken down and cleaned and inspected by amazon. Which was quite the opposite. There was still crud and splatter from whoever owned it previously. A simple wipe down of the outer case left the slightly wet paper towel I used brown. The wipe down around the keyboard was even worse. How do I know there isn’t semen and lube left on there. Wiped the whole thing down with germ killer. Gross. If I didn’t need the computer I’d send it back. Bad form, Amazon."
5.0,Good product,It was for my son and he loves it. Corners got a little scuffed in transit.
5.0,Sorry I'm not available to use my phone to good to be true. I'll try harder. Sorry Amazon,"Now this is my favorite part of my MacBook Pro and  I'm hoping to get started with learning how to use it better, I've never been in it  and I need to learn more about my phone before I go to the laptop. Yeah, so I have a little trouble signing in and out, and I'm always messing up on my phone as I try to make orders for this stuff I'm buying. I'm hoping to get better and won't be messing up my orders for this app"
4.0,Good,So far so good. Some buttons don’t register you have to hit it a few times. The battery doesn’t last a whole day. We even let it die completely and unplugged it as soon as it was done and still doesn’t last.
1.0,"After receiving this 2x because it was damaged both times, it has now stopped working after 4 months",Beyond mad!
1.0,Very Dissatisfied!!!,Very disappointed!! Whoever refurbished it left a lot of the previous persons passcodes in it and can’t use half of the items. Called Apple and they said it would be very costly to get it back to working order. Very disappointed!!
5.0,I was wowed for used,Almost as clean as new and worked perfectly. I was pleasantly surprised
5.0,Wonderful buy !!!,"I love my Mac pro laptop I just purchased (refurbished, however, it looks and acts like brand new) !! Not only was it a great deal but It was delivered expeditiously!! Great product for the price !!"
5.0,Great Purchase from PrimeBuys,"Mine looks and runs like new. After reading all the negative reviews I decided to buy mine from PrimeBuys for $40 more to give myself a better chance at getting a great MacBook Pro. It has a fresh install of the latest version of Sierra. I did not test the battery because mine is always plugged in for Home Sharing. It has a gigabit ethernet port. The only somewhat bad thing is that they didn't name the main hard drive ... it should have been named ""Macintosh HD"" but it is ""untitled"""
5.0,Five Stars,Great price for what you get and so far working as advertised.
5.0,Great computer,Love Mac
1.0,DO NOT BUY from this seller.,This was not a good experience. The computer does not work right and is not accepting the latest update. DO NOT BUY from this seller. We will never buy an electronic on Amazon again.
1.0,Junk,Received this Apple Mac Book Pro and would not even turn on. Customer service connected me with Apple. They advised computer ram was bad. I sent it back for a refund. Don’t waste your money!
1.0,Received and Returned the same day,"I tried it and was disappointed. You get what you pay for is the cliche thing to say but my experience is I got the computer one day and returned it the same day. iTunes wouldn’t load and the App Store didn’t work and Gmail didn’t work, but safari worked. I spent the extra $300 on a quality Apple computer and I felt a lot better."
3.0,"Great value, but for experienced mac users.","I think this is just straight up used and not refurbished. Still good value, but don’t get if you’re expecting it to run like new. It needed to have the hard drive wiped and MacOS reinstalled. Which is so easy to do, I don’t know why the seller didn’t just do it. Runs great after I did that."
4.0,Four Stars,Enjoying it
3.0,I do like the laptop,"I do like the laptop, I think that it is nice. But, there are some misstatements that need to be addressed. First, the body is nice and only has one or two tiny marks on it. If you didn't ""inspect"" it, you probably would not see it. So good job, it does look rather new and clean. Nothing was shipped damaged etc, I've seen pictures where the charger was horribly damaged and not in any condition to be used for anything other than a sorry paperweight. The computer functions rather well, I say rather because I'm not overly happy about it. When you open more than three windows, it lags soooooooo bad. With 4 G memory, mail, internet, and spreadsheet should not lag the computer so horribly. Besides the internet is not doing videos or music, it's on a static page. Also, my major issue is that it claims to have a seven-hour battery life. How about two-three hours. Literally, all I use this for at work is my scheduling software, mail and invoicing - sometimes for kicks I throw in the spreadsheet and close down something else. So, while I do like the laptop - I don't like the misleading on the battery life or the fact that more than three things open causes such a lag."
5.0,better condition than I even imagined,"better condition than I even imagined. Certified Apple Product, and it doesn't have a ding dent or smudge on it. ***** for sure."
2.0,Not worth it,"Luckily I got my refund, but when I got the laptop I was upset to see it was a 2012. Also when picking up heard something very loose in the casing of it. I would look somewhere else."
2.0,Not the best,After a month the screen starts to wobble. Find out tha the screws holding it were lose. Not a good quality refurbished job
1.0,Poor quality product.,Product broke after about 90 days.  Needed to be rebuilt  Not a good vendor
4.0,Nothing Really. Just It does what is supposed to do,Can't use Windows 10
2.0,Bs,I should’ve done this before I bought this stupid thing but I check the apple website and this laptop not even worth 125 and yet I paid 450 for this BS. I start to realize that I may have been ripped off cause as soon as I open the package I see wolverine scratches going up and down the top and bottom of the laptop. The screen and the mousepad clean but this thing is not worth the price. Im about to  return it. Not worth it.
5.0,MacBook replacement,"Replaced a Mac AirBook that went caput, my fault not the"
5.0,Great product thank you,"Not one mark on it, could not even tell that it was a refurbished unit. Great product thank you."
5.0,Apple products are great,"Great computer,easy to use and small"
4.0,Four Stars,"A few scratches on front cover, but otherwise works great"
1.0,One Star,They don't respond as fast as they say in the description. I had problems with the guarantee
5.0,Excellent purchase for an older MacBook,Love my MacBook.  I was hesitant at first because of the reviews but I'm glad I purchased.  The package arrived promptly.  My only disappointment is that it didn't come with a charger so I had to purchase one ($99 from Best Buy).  I have been able to hold a charge for up to three days before needing to recharge .  Overall a good deal !!!
1.0,One Star,"I actually liked the computer. But the letter ""Q"" didn't work. So I returned it."
3.0,Wish I never bought,The slowest thing I’ve ever had! It won’t pull up apps without a 10 minute wait and then kicks you out. Total waste of my money.
5.0,Five Stars,Great products and the price is right.
3.0,Make sure that it work before sending,So the plug didn’t work. I was told I would receive a new one  Never received never was received
5.0,and look amazing!!,"While it does have a few scuffs here and there, I fully expected that being refurbished! As far as everything else, it runs smooth, and look amazing!!! Thank you so much!(:"
4.0,Works great but had some dents,"Knew we were buying a refurbished laptop but the description didn't include the dents and scratches that were on the outside.  It works great.  Other than the dings, no complaints."
1.0,Don’t buy used. Buy new,Dislike. Won’t charge. Dies quickly when it decides to charge. Slow. My guess it was a piss poor job of being refurbished
1.0,Livid,I was expecting a newer model MacBook and instead received a 2011 MacBook Pro with files missing from the computer to where I couldn’t even start it up. Although it was returned I don’t recommend this to any one
1.0,Hardrive broke after 3 1/2 month,Headline says it all
4.0,"Computer works great, the only two issues I had was","Computer works great, the only two issues I had was. 1) the charger cable did not work so I had to buy a new one. 2) it had more scratches and dents than describe but that's just me being picky. For the price this is a great find!"
1.0,Overpriced door stop.,"I owned this product for exactly four days. The battery consistently died within mere minutes of having a full charge. Finally, the thing just turned off, and never turned back on again... AFTER I put all my files and information on it."
5.0,Awesome,Unbelievable IT's like NEW ... Works perfect ... Thank you!
3.0,Powert cord didn't work,"The computer works great, however, it came with a dead power cable.  It cost $80 to replace...."
1.0,One Star,Was dirty with dents all on it.  Horrible I was surprised @Amazon
3.0,Works but definitely looks used.,"First thing I noticed when I took it out of the box were  the scratches on the lid and upon turning it over saw 2 screws loose, protruding from their holes.  I installed os high sienna and it seems to be working fine, it just appears beat up cosmetically, not like new."
5.0,Amazing! 5 stars!,Omg love this Mac book! Exactly what I wanted and more the. What I needed! Perfect condition! Exceeded expectations!
5.0,Good starter Mac,Great starter Mac.  I upgraded this to 16 gigs of ram and swapped out the 500 gig hard drive 500ssd. Works great no problems and was cosmetically good looking. My only issue is the the battery drains kind of fast so I'm guessing I will have to replace that soon but other then that works great.
5.0,awesome,"Fast...Easy...Good picture quality...Overall, a very nice laptop."
1.0,Arrived DOA,Arrived DOA. many scratches. I wouldn't classify as refurbished. Returned right away

Después de una revisión de Apple decidí devolverlo. Gracias a Amazon por respaldarme y aceptar mi devolución!!!!!"
1.0,Don’t buy from these people,Computer stopped working after 3rd time turning it on not worth the money
5.0,Great laptop,"I have never owned a Mac before , and this is a great computer."
4.0,only 4 stars cause i read bad reviews about the company selling stuff that breaks in ...,only 4 stars cause i read bad reviews about the company selling stuff that breaks in a few months but so far so good i don't see those reviews being applicable in this case
5.0,Great 👍🏼,The computer is great quality & minor scratches. The battery however is a little hot. I will take to computer shop for diagnostics. Overall ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
