1.0,"If ""Better than expected performance at an unbeatable price"" sounds too good to be true, that's because it is.","Note, there are 3 components of this REVISED review. The 1st regarding the product, the 2nd regarding the vendor. And the third comprising my experiences of both after the unit failed within the warranty period, and the vendor's attempts to avoid honoring their supposed warranty."
2.0,Buyer Beware!,"At first I was very pleased with the computer, but after one month it started flickering on the screen. I contacted the seller who responded quickly. After a few informational email exchanges, I have not heard back from him about resolving the issue. I was leery about purchasing a refurbished computer and now wish I had not."
1.0,RIP OFF,I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  The return window closed January 31st and it DIED February 20th!  I will NEVER purchase from them again.
1.0,Screen cracked and only turns on when it wants,Great price... worth every penny apparently. Screej came cracked in the corner and when you turn it on the screen comes on when it feels like. Wish I looked harder. Merry Christmas to me...
2.0,I thought that when you got refurbished that it worked ...,"I thought that when you got refurbished that it worked. I had to replace the battery, the only way you could use this is if it was plugged in. It was also very scratched. Not someplace I would use again."
4.0,Loving the Book!,These Dell Chrome Books are really nice! We got them for our boys ages 13 and 11 for Christmas. They use them for homework and playing games! Itâ€™s one game that they really play that they canâ€™t play on this chrome book because it doesnâ€™t have windows. Rowblocks is the name of the game I think! Lol.... about two months after getting the books we noticed that they wouldnâ€™t charge and they could only use them if they were plugged in. We contacted the company and sent them back and two weeks later they sent them out knew books. These are working great! Turns out the both of the books had bad battery packs. Customer service was great and I would definitely buy from them again!
1.0,Four months after product purchased the top half of the ...,Four months after product purchased the top half of the monitor stopped working.  Dell would not help since it was purchased from a 3rd party.
1.0,Waste of money,Donâ€™t purchase my sons screen doesnâ€™t light up. Waste of money.
5.0,Fortunately I was able to remove them,I really needed an upgrade from my old Dell pc and this definitely did the trick.  The only problem I had with the product were loose screws in the computer.  Fortunately I was able to remove them.
1.0,Arrived broken,This product arrived broken. The mouse did not move on the screen at all. I knew I was taking a chance but expected a product that at least worked when new. Returned this immediately
5.0,Refurbished and works like new,I ordered this unit to replace my daughters 7 year old laptop. She normally only works on line to read articles or research things that interest her. This is lighter than her old laptop and is faster by far as it has a SSD drive in it. if she needs to do anything more she has the google suite of apps to draw from so software is not an issue.
5.0,Refurbished is FINE!,"Received my order quickly and in good shape, So far the refurbished unit is running just fine. The outside of the case had a few scratches, Other than that it seems to be in good order and is meeting my needs. I'm finding that the 11"" screen may be a little small. So I'm kind of wishing I might've gotten a 12"" or 13"". But for the price, really can't beat it."
4.0,Good product but a bit older...,This is a perfect Chromebook for a high school student.  It will do the job very well.  My refurbished unit was bought from Certified-Technology and it looked brand new and had a battery with a life expectancy of 100%.  The cost for a student and the likelihood of damage make the price range for a refurbished product a good deal.
1.0,Chromebook  used,"This Chromebook came with out a password, therefore I could not sign in.  I called the info supplied and was told that for $129.00 they could ""fix that"",  I returned it!  Michaela"
1.0,Problems getting it to turn on,"I have had persistent problems getting this Chromebook to boot up. Now it's just dead - won't turn on at all. I suppose this is what I should have expected from a ""refurbished"" item. It had visible wear when I received it, and did not respond to the power key consistently. I just kept it turned on. Now it's dead."
1.0,Didnâ€™t work.,I thought Iâ€™d get lucky because all the other reviews were pretty bad. But I didnâ€™t. Donâ€™t waste your time mine wouldnâ€™t charge and would just shut down randomly because the battery wouldnâ€™t hold a charge. Waste of money. And they make you pay for the return porstage also. And lastly. The touch pad was messed up. Sometimes it would work and sometimes it wouldnâ€™t. Believe the reviews and donâ€™t even bother with it
2.0,It works but really been used a lot,"Big line of something on the screen that won't come of and mouse pad takes a lot of taps to make it work.It is used and does work but not as good as I would have expected,maybe next time I will listen to my wife a buy new instead,you get what you pay for,like it or not"
1.0,Did not work~,"This arrived and had a cracked screen. I called to find out what could be done, was referred to the manufacturer, who said nothing. We returned it."
1.0,Cannot download games/not user friendly,Awful.  Hard to use.  Bought for 10 year old son.
1.0,Do not by from this company,Nothing they say about this Crome book is true I brought three for my kids for school because they were required and to save a few bucks but like they say you get what you pay for. None of the 3 an I mean not one works and no one from the third party sales will return my call
4.0,Thermal issues and track pad issue besides that all good,first of all i know this is a refurbished laptop but trackpad isnt the best (sometimes it doesn't detect me clicking) but it has a nice feel to it
1.0,Waste of money!,This is HORRIBLE!  The monitor will not stay on and does not come back on easily. Powering off then back on does not help! DO NOT buy it!
1.0,One Star,Product came with none functioning keys. Can be used returning to seller
1.0,This item was not in the condition that I expected,"The computer had scratches and I had to even wipe it down as it appeared to be dirty the box that it was delivered in was old and in bad condition I was not satisfied, I do not have time to send it back as it is a Christmas gift I have to send to Houston, TX very disappointed! Computer even had a sticker mark where evidentially a sticker had been. ðŸ˜•"
2.0,"Bad trackpad, had to return it","The trackpad wouldn't respond to clicks half the time, so I returned it. Otherwise it would have been a good buy at $99... cosmetically it looked great, and I was able to update it to the latest ChromeOS version; I buy lots of refurbished Chromebooks and sometimes older ones can't be updated, which substantially reduces their value."
1.0,When I got this Chromebook it had scratches on it ...,When I got this Chromebook it had scratches on it which I was not expecting on the front and back.
1.0,Screen scratched,"The screen came with a scratch and the shift key sticks. I was skeptical about buying ""refurbished"" products. Some of the items seem ok...but others are sold as refurbished despite defects. For fifty dollars difference better it is better to buy the new product instead of a defective item I do not mind scratches, but not on the screen.."
1.0,Ok for a kids first laptop,"This is my second certified refurbished,  the first have a bad screen (had spots across the center). So they sent me another and this one has very deep and many scratches on and around mouse pad, but the screen is good and my daughter is ok with it. I thought for the money it should have been in a little better shape."
1.0,Disappointed buyer,"Very disappointed when I opened the computer to find a line across the middle of the screen. A screw was also not placed on the bottom of the keyboard- leaving the bottom of the keyboard falling off. Luckily, Amazon offered to send a replacement."
4.0,The tablet does not have Google play store,Overall I like the product but I think that in the specs you should let people know whether or not it has Google play store this one does not which means you can't really download anything on its 100% internet but that's still working for my purpose in the future I will sell this one and get me one that has Google play store
3.0,No instructions,Product arrived on time.  However there was only the chromebook and the charging cable in a box.  No instructions or anything explaining the product.  Good thing this was for my 9 year old and my husband already has one.
1.0,One Star,The laptop was completely busted. it doesn't worth 140 dollars. I could see the inside of the keyboard
5.0,No Frills ChromeBook,"Bought as a replacement for a ChromeBook I previously had.  The other worked really well for six years.  I damaged the screen or I would still be using it.  This works just as well.  Couldn't even tell it was a refurb.  For just surfing the net, it just works."
1.0,Attention: I NEED MY POWER CORD!!!,"Attention: I did not get the power cord to this computer and the computer is completely dead, no power to it to get on it. So what do I need to do now?? I guess I need to send it back. Iâ€™ve never had any problems or anything to be or go wrong when Iâ€™ve ordered from here. I need my power cord to my computer"
4.0,for $100 it works fine,"Didn't expect much, but it exceeded my expectations for a chromebook.  Nice having multiple usb ports as some chromebooks only have one."
1.0,The delivery of items was incomplete!!,The computer did not come with the charger cord. So my child could not use the computer right away.
5.0,So Far So Good,This is what I was expecting from the ChromeBook. It works fine. I like that I can hook up a USB mouse and keyboard to it as well. So I've had it almost a month and so far so good.
5.0,more than expected,"This is for my 14 daughter hope it can last, overall good performance for more than a month of use. I hope that it does not has any future issue dell support is really bad."
5.0,Great!,"My daughter bought this for school and it has been great. No problems with it, or dents. We are very happy with this purchase."
2.0,Screen is coming off,Screen is coming off and overheats quickly
1.0,Lines on screen,"I bought 2 of these. One for my teenage son and one for my pre-teen daughter. They worked well for about 4 months and then both like clock work ended up with lines running across the screen. I wish I would have read all these reviews, cause this seller is taking a lot of peopleâ€™s hard earned money and giving junk!"

5.0,Small but mighty!!,"Dell Chromebook is a great value!! Not only do you receive the Dell name you know and trust, you receive it plus Chromecast in one tiny package!!"
3.0,Good,Not going to lie the laptop it self isnâ€™t bulky and has great sound and good graphics. I thought i could play my game on this computer and bought a external cd drive and realized it canâ€™t play pc games unless they are online. This would be good for a work computer or just to watch videos and online games
