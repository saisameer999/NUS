2.0,Barely browses the internet,"So little storage and computing power, it barely let's you browse the internet. The CPU is always maxed out, the RAM maxes out all the time, and free disk space is nearly all used when you get the machine. There is a reason it is $199. If you click on something, doesn't matter what it is, expect a 3 to 5 second delay.  Oh, and the 12 month Office subscription apparently started 5 months before I bought it. Spend a little more and buy something else. Yikes. An Acer tablet would be a better buy. Even the Samsung tablet I bought is far superior. Get a bluetooth keyboard with the tablet and you'd have a far superior machine."
5.0,Great deal!!,Great buy!!

4.0,seems nice,"It was a gift so i can't really say too much, but it fired it up, it was nice looking, clear screen, and it's big."
5.0,Great product for the price,"I was skeptical as the price is inexpensive. You get what you pay for syndrome. However, the quality is wonderful. It is extremely lightweight and I loved it from the moment I set it up. A terrific buy and great quality!"
1.0,Disappointed,"This computer was unable to perform simple tasks. Kept freezing, even with something as simple as browsing the web."
