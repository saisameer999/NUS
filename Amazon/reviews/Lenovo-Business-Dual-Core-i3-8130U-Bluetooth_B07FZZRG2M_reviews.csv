5.0,Value Business Laptop,"I was looking for something that would allow me to do what I needed at work, without having to break the bank to do it. This laptop is just that. Here are my thoughts so far."
5.0,"Just as discribed, cheap and it works","Works well, not the fastest laptop around, but for the price I didnt expect a speed demon.  What it is, is a solid cheap laptop that works.  A little word processing some light photo editing and web browsing.  I use my desktop for the heavy lifting"
5.0,Awesome for the price!,"I'm an insurance agent. I mainly use this machine for document storage/display and internet access/email. For my purpose, it's perfect. For the price, the weight/processor speed/battery life is totally acceptable. In a perfect world, I would own a laptop that was blazing fast with a 17"" screen, weighed 2 lbs and had a battery that lasted 8 hours. For under $1,000. But...."
4.0,Good value for the money,"I bought this for my Dad to replace an HP laptop that he's had for about 6 years now.  He only needs a laptop to do e-mail and use Word.  He's using it with a wireless keyboard and mouse.  The laptop looks a lot sleeker than his old laptop, it has a silver finish.  The power supply has an L-shape at the end and doesn't go in completely.  All the inputs are on the left side.  The network cable has a flexible opening (lower side can drop down), there is an hdmi port (no VGA), and USB ports and what appears to be a micro USB port.  On the right hand side is a cd-drive.  It's a bit slow to start up but seems to work well so far.  I have it connected to an external monitor - this gave issues since the monitor was VGA and the output was at 1280 x 1050, so I had to open the Intel Graphics tray and change the output to the same as the laptop then click on expand to fit the screen of the 22"" monitor."
5.0,Great laptop for listed price,"This is a great laptop for everyday personal and business use. The item arrived on time and had all features as was described online. Have had no issues so far. It is everything what you would expect of a new Lenovo laptop. I like the relatively slimmer look and feel, especially for a laptop of this size. Very convenient to carry around because of its light weight."
4.0,nice computer,Really like this computer so far. Easy to use and a nice Keyboard. Like the slimness of it. And it does come with a DVD drive as shown in the photo. Who knows why the info says otherwise.
1.0,Faulty screen.,WOULD have been a great laptop but the screen went out after about 10 minutes.
5.0,Great laptop for the price,"I absolutely love this laptop. It's so sleek and stylish. I wouldn't say the speed is the best but it's more than decent for the price. I mostly use it for school and work and it does everything it's supposed to without any delays. Compared to HP and some other laptops I had in the past, this one outperforms all of them. Highly recommend it, especially if you're on the budget."
5.0,Great Value in a Laptop!,I bought this to replace my 7 year old Toshiba that was dropped one too many times.
5.0,Good for School and Media.,"Bought this for my little sister, and she mostly watches Netflix and works on homework on that laptop. Good stuff!"
4.0,Inexpensive but worksell,The screen is ok but not great but what should be expected on a laptop in this price range. So far it has been reliable and does what I bought it for just fine. It's no Mac Pro but fills the need for an inexpensive computer.
5.0,As expected.,I was looking for an easy to use LT for my business.  I don't use it for games or movies or internet surfing.  Works well for running my business.
5.0,Just learning Windows 10,"So far so good. Slow learning process but I am a senior guy , but the laptop seems to be working very well."
4.0,real value for money,"fast , hassle free, easy. hope it continues like this"
4.0,Seems ok so far,"So far I’m not having any issues the item itself. HOWEVER....I was told security would require my signing for the pkg.  This not only didn’t happen, but the box was left in plain sight on my front porch. I WAS NOT PLEASED!"
5.0,Great for the price,Great value laptop
1.0,P.O.S.,This laptop has good components and a good keyboard for the price. That’s where the good stops. So much bloatware the thing will barely turn on(after 5 minutes of loading). Disc is at 100% usage just sitting on desktop. Decided to return after 10 minutes of use
5.0,Excellent for the Price,As described.
1.0,Nunca llegó a mi mano.,No puedo decir qué me agradó o no de ella porque nunca llegó a mi mano. Por error me llegó otro artículo. Me hicieron el reembolso del dinero pero después de un mes y medio.
5.0,Great,Great laptop super useful for your office
