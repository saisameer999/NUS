5.0,"This is a typewriter with internet, and that's why I love it","I work and play mainly from a desktop, but I wanted something cheap and portable that I can use when I need a change of scenery. I was looking for three things in a laptop: 1) small footprint, 2) looooong battery life, and 3) low cost. Basically, I needed a typewriter with internet, and I didn't want to invest too much money or time into it. This machine checks all three of my boxes. It's itty bitty and very lightweight, and so far I haven't been able to drain the battery in a single day of on and off use. I also purchased this during a Deal of the Day promotion for $179, which is a great price for a PC with these specs. I don't know if I would pay full price for this, which is around $230 at the time of posting. If I'm going to spend that much, I might as well increase my budget slightly and get something with a few more bells and whistles, like a convertible hinge or a touch screen."
5.0,Excellent Linux Laptop!,"The mother of all motherboard makers, Asus again teams with Intel to create yet another awesome, small but full-function laptop. On day 1 I plugged in the power, then my "
1.0,HDMI port died after two months.,"This notebook is not of a great quality. The HDMI port died after two months. I spoke to ASUS tech support, they issued RMA number and I sent the notebook to ASUS with Windows 10 Pro operating system as I upgraded it from Windows S mode. I got back my notebook after two weeks. They had to replace the motherboard. However, it came back with ""Windows 10 Home Single Language"" installed on it. They downgraded my operating system. I was extremely unhappy. I spoke to ASUS tech support and complained, they issued me another RMA number and I had to send the notebook right back to them for correct operating system. Now, I'm out of my notebook for almost a month now. I'm still waiting for my computer to get back. I'll post the progress when I get the notebook back the second time."
5.0,Great basic PC laptop,"I purchased this PC laptop for school. I didn't want to spend too much, but I needed it to have Windows 10 and the ability to house/run Office 365. I was far more interested in the technical specs, I hadn't paid much attention to the dimensions. It is pretty small (see photos for reference), but other than the occasional need to divide my screen view between 2 programs, I actually like the size. It will be easy to bring along when traveling and it is extremely lightweight. This order arrived to me in winter, so I let the computer sit and come up to temperature before attempting to run it. Windows Cortana prompts you through all of the setup. It connected to my WiFi without any problems. I happen to prefer Chrome as a browser, but Microsoft Edge is the default for Windows 10 S. I was able to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for free and download Chrome as my default. I had no issues executing this & once again Cortana prompted me throughout the process. I was able to install Office 365 without issues. The battery life seems great - a fully charged battery will get you roughly 10 hours of use, depending on how you're using it. It seems to charge really fast as well, which is another nice perk. I have had no problems completing my coursework using this laptop. It seems like a really big bang for very little buck. I would highly recommend it for students, commuters or the general population who mainly will utilize for surfing the web. Obviously internet speed will play a role in video performance, but the visual quality of the screen is great for streaming. The built-in speakers are perfectly adequate for general notification sounds, listening to music or videos. I like that it has a USB port on either side and also offers the mini-SD card reader, HDMI and mini-USB ports. It has a decent amount of capabilities for such a relatively small and extremely inexpensive computer. Given the Intel processor, on-board storage and ram, I find this to be a cut above its Chromebook counterparts which can limit your capabilities being an app-based operating system. I ranked the material quality slightly lower among the features, purely because it is SO lightweight. I don't know how durable this plastic housing will prove to be in comparison to many of the laptops with a metal shell. I don't see it being a problem for me, but I wouldn't recommend this for use of small children."
1.0,Failed after eight months.,"April 20, 2019 update:  Well, you can see my earlier, glowing report below.  But now eight months later, the screen went black while using, can't reboot.  %^&*."
5.0,what's wrong with it,"I would like to ask the people who give this computer a bad review: what's wrong with it?  This is one of the nicest computers that I have ever owned.  Not because it is a workhorse computer--because it isn't.  But because it works perfectly for what it was designed to do.  It is super light; it is small; it is very fast; it has a battery that lasts all day; and it never fails to perform the functions that it was designed for.  It does a fantastic job for the price.  Of course you are not going to do any heavy gaming or video editing on this computer.  If that is what you want a computer to do then you have to spend big money.  But if you want a computer that does the basic functions, like web browsing or using Microsoft office, then this would be the computer for you.  There is no such thing as a company that doesn't produce a lemon on occasion, and if you are one of the unlucky people who happen to buy a lemon, then, of course, buy all means, return it.  However, after using the replacement for awhile you will find that this computer is really perfect for what you want to do.  I see so many bad reviews that end by saying ""I am going to return this computer.""  Really!  maybe you should have returned it and received a replacement and then used it for awhile before you gave it a bad review.  If, by chance, you did receive another lemon--which is highly unlikely--then, and only then, would you be justified in giving it a bad rating.  All-in-all, my personal opinion is simply this: this computer far exceeds the purpose for which it was designed.  I have had not problems with it whatsoever.  It is faster than I thought it would be.  It runs cooler than I thought it would.  The screen is brighter than I imagined it would be.  The sound is louder and more clear than I expected.  The track pad works smoother than I anticipated.  And, last-but-not-least, the keypad is very responsive.  I have not been disappointed in this computer, and for the price, I don't think you will be either."
5.0,Linux Perspective,"I bought this specifically for Linux Mint. I was surprised fast boot was enabled by default. This made setting the boot order or any Firmware settings impossible without starting Windows. I used advanced startup in Windows to make it boot to the Bios. I disabled fast boot and secure boot , then saved and restarted. Now the F2 key worked to enter the Bios. Then a restart and tapping the ESC key provided a boot menu. The Mint 19.1 installer live provided my wireless network. I did a custom install using Btrfs with no swap (4GB memory is plenty for what I use.) Everything went well. When I booted to the freshly installed system, everything looked okay. At this point I decided to update the firmware in the Bios. I had downloaded the file from Asus using the model E203MA version 304. The Bios flash did not complete. It informed me it was the wrong one. After much digging, including a support call to Asus, I was ready to give up. On a whim, I tried the Bios flash for a E203MAS version 202 and it worked. The Asus tech had assured me this laptop was an E203MS.  So 'm guessing these are either E203MAS  or E203MA. The laptop says model: E203M on the back. It is a very confusing way they have their models identified. Anyway, Everything on this laptop is real nice. The location of the power button (and indicator light) the responsiveness of the whole system, and the build quality. Neither Mint nor Windows show the hyper threading is active. I tried several system monitors with both OS and no certainty. It may be active or not. I have read that due to security recently, hyper threading has been disabled on some mobos. At any rate, the machine is very responsive. It's not easy to find a laptop that runs Linux these days. I've returned 2 others from Wally World that would not, or had issues like wireless cards that I could not find drivers for. On these Windows 10  Pro can be clean installed. Just download a copy of the Oct version of Windows 10 and use the Media Creation Tool -  select USB with an 8GB - to 32GB flash drive attached. It will create a FAT32 installer. It must be FAT32 or it won't show up in the boot menu. (tap ESC key after pressing power button) Some PCs will detect a GPT table flash drive with NTFS - not these Vivo. Boot to it,  Erase the drive and install. It won't ask for a license key or version of Windows you want (auto-detects.) Once installed  and connected to the internet it will activate your fresh copy of Pro. Before doing this make sure you have previously booted the factory install of Windows 10 s. I did this after having Linux on it just to test. I put it back to Linux when done."
5.0,Excellent Value Ultra portable,"at $169 this was an excellent value ultra portable. intel N4100 isn't the fastest processor but it will handle anything you throw at it with exception to intensive games and maybe some advanced processor-intensive software. upgrade to windows 10 pro for free, and re-install a fresh copy of windows without the asus bloat and this thing is snappy. expect to get about 6 hrs of medium use, and over 10 for light use like just web browsing, email, etc."
4.0,Great Travel Laptop For The Price!,"This is, what I consider to be, an ideal Travel Laptop.  It is certainly light weight and has everything you need for online activities.  Yes, it has only 64gb of storage, but that is enough to handle the Windows 10 pro operating system (easily installed from your free Microsoft Account) as well as office applications.  If you want more storage, you can use a micro SD card and/or a flash USB drive.  The ports are adequate (HDMI, USB, MICRO-C, etc.).  The display is easy enough to read (which is what I want most), and I have found no issues with WI-FI or Bluetooth connections to any device.  If you want lots of built-in storage and power to do multi-tasking and play intense games, then this laptop is not for you.  But if you just want to connect to online services, surf the web, run basic office applications, and travel light, then you cannot beat the features for the price!"
5.0,GOODBYE CHROMEBOOKS,OK! this laptop (if it already hasnt) will cause a wave of other laptop manufacturers to create budget laptops just like this one.
5.0,A 2019 Netbook,"I don't like to write immediate reviews on any of my Amazon purchases because first impressions can easily change with some experience, but I've now had three weeks to use the ASUS E203MA, and I am very satisfied with this purchase.  The battery life has remained good, and there's little doubt that I can get between 9-10 hours of life with normal use and the screen brightness reduced from the highest level. Under those conditions, I've used the computer for just about 8 hours and the battery still has about 22% left on it. The battery meter does give some screwy readings occasionally regarding the length of time the battery will continue to run; for instance, with the percentage remaining at 50%, swinging from a little over ten hours to less than three hours in a manner of a few minutes so I've measured battery life by monitoring the cumulative amount of time I've run it."
3.0,A little disappointing,"I must say that I was a little disappointed by this laptop. Yeah, I know its never going to read any speed contests, but I had a E200HA for over a year so I felt like I knew what I was getting with this laptop. Unfortunately there were a few things that disappointed, the biggest of which was the smallest change: the lack of perceived performance improvement from the E200HA model."
5.0,ASUS finally got it right,"I have multiple ASUS laptops (x205ta, e200ha, ux305la). Their laptops tend to be the most portable among the peers, but some fatal flaws keep them from being great."
2.0,Can't beat it for the price,Update 2 months after purchase:
1.0,Got black screen in less than 2 weeks,"After 11 days of purchased, all I get is a black screen.  Had to return it!!"
5.0,Excellent Budget Linux Machine,"I bought this laptop and immediately installed Arch Linux with the XFCE desktop on it and added a 200GB micro SD card for added game and music storage. The system only takes about 300MB of RAM out of 3.71GB usable by the system, I also enabled zram compression. It also takes a measly 10GB of the storage space after I installed the system, all sorts of development and multimedia software as well as game emulators. It's an awesome machine still achieves 8-10 hours under Arch running TLP power management. It will emulate most systems up to about the GameCube and some Wii games or the PSP/DS and some 3DS games on the handheld front. It boots up fast with systemd-boot. I also tried the Deepin desktop on it which looked and performed beautifully but I am more accustomed to XFCE myself. Video acceleration works under VLC for x265 playback in hardware. The Intel HD 600 GPU also has full Vulkan support as well as OpenGL 4.6 support under Linux! All around a great performer for playing lighter Steam games (Terraria, Killing Floor, Prison Architect, RimWorld, Starbound, Stardew Valley all verified), emulation, web browsing with several tabs, music, video, etc. I used a 1440p 60hz panel with the HDMI with no problems as well. Bluetooth, wifi, keyboard multi keys, and touchpad gestures all work out of the box on 5.0.2 Arch kernel. The screen does have a sweet spot for viewing angles but for $199 this is an AWESOME Linux machine! Under Arch I could use this as a daily."
4.0,Very nice portable machine,"I actually ended up returning this particular computer because it had become out of stock after I paid for it. I was sent a similar machine with a larger screen, but with only 32GB internal storage. I already had this same computer with 32GB for a significantly lower price, so I returned the substitute. Apparently it is available again now."
4.0,Cheap but good,"This suits my needs perfectly for college. It's small and lightweight, so it's not annoying to lug around, and it comes with relatively good specs for a budget laptop."
5.0,The Little Engine (PC) That Could,"What can I say? WOW! I'm so glad I bought this PC! It's the best low-cost laptop I've ever purchased. As a PC technician I highly recommend this laptop. I've been putting it though its paces in the past 24 hours. I've been trying to ""break"" it but I can't. It's practically indestructible for novices.  The first thing that quickly stands out to me is the speed and responsiveness in Windows and the Internet. No need to worry about anyone with clumsy fingers or in the habit of tinkering with things they may not know about. This laptop can take anything you throw at it. It's a perfect fit for beginners to professionals. I'm typing this review on it. The Keyboard is so smooth and quiet and comfortable. The display is high quality. Fast boot and restarts. It comes with Windows 10 S but is easy to convert to Windows 10 Pro if you wish to install other programs that are not in Microsoft Windows Store such as Firefox or Chrome. Small but powerful speakers with plenty of volume. It has enough RAM (4 Gig) and storage (64 Gig) to open up as many as 10 to 12 browser windows with no degradation in speed. It's a laptop that looks and feels like a tablet with an attached keyboard. I should have mentioned this feature first: The battery! Wow. It barely uses power! It really does last, for me, about 11 to 12 hours without recharging! No overheating. Thus far, I can't find any CONS with this laptop. Go buy this laptop!"
5.0,"Computadora genial y ligera, perfecta para movilizarse.","Es una computadora genial para usar linux, yo tengo la distribución UBUNTU 18.4  y funciona perfecta!"
5.0,I’m very happy with this.,"This is perfect for carrying everyday. It has everything I need. It has the bitlocker and Hyper-V(virtual machine) features which are really nice. I don’t have it on my other bigger full size laptop - FYI l, if you want to install basically any application, you’ll need to switch to the windows pro mode from the current OS. All you need to do is go to the App Store and search for Windows pro. And it’s free!"
5.0,Purchased as Used-Acceptable for $75 under the new price. Could not tell from new.,"I have been working on the unit non-stop for 2 days. No problems with speed or functionality. Running 3 heavy file transfers is slow but the unit is quick with basic Internet and Office related tasks. Had no problem updating to Win 10 Pro for free. Loaded plenty of apps for use when traveling. Added a 256 gig Samsung micro card and loaded it with music, movies, images, ePubs. etc. Netflix, iTunes, Pandora, etc. all work fine. Very happy with the purchase."
5.0,Just what I needed,"I have my 15 inch dell from 2011 that’s still kicking but it’s too big to carry to say a coffee shop if I wanted to get work done and it’s very loud. This small computer is perfect for on the go. I just downloaded chrome which is what i use and it works great. It’s light, and is quiet, very portable. Really like this laptop! I was going to buy a Lenovo or a dell 11.6 but glad I went with asus. The display is not matte so it’s a win! I love it!"
4.0,Asus VivoBook E203ma with N3350 and 64gb of storage,"Out of the box, it took a while to start and set up. For a few days it works pretty good for lightweight tasks. I simply use it for internet browsing (using Microsoft Edge since it's quite fast and built for windows 10), emails, and homework. It gets warm on the left side of the keyboard but not too hot. Lasts about 5 hours on battery, depending on brightness and what you're doing of course. I'm being cautious in using this laptop, such as closing the lid or turning on and off."
4.0,Low cost easy-to-use laptop,"The Windows 10 S limits the downloadable applications the user can download, which is good for when you're getting this for a student so that they can focus more on their studies as opposed to downloading games. The specs are subpar but decent enough for someone who is just going to do homework."
5.0,Surprisingly great computer for the price,"I recently bought this computer because I needed something small and light that I could take with me to work. To be honest, I have been positively impressed by its performance. It runs all the programs that I need, including my NatGeo learning presentation tools and Mimio Studio software (I'm an ESL teacher). It even runs my favorite computer games, StarCraft I and II without problems. It boots up really quickly, and so far the only ""flaw"" that I can complain about is the lack of onboard storage because it only has a 64 GB C: drive, but that got easily remedied with a micro SD card and a portable, external HDD.  So far, I am a perfectly happy customer with it."
5.0,Great Laptop,"I had drug my feet for a while on getting a new laptop for personal use.  Partly because I was hesitant to shell out the money and had my work laptop if needed.  After reading a ton of reviews on various laptops, I finally settled on this one. I was skeptical with getting the small screen and how the performance would be, but so far it has been fantastic."
5.0,A great roadie for the money,"I've had this laptop for about 6 weeks now. This laptop is the most used of my Win 10 computers in our house. Others are a 14"" Acer and a Win 10 Desktop. I have loaded Office 365 in addition to several other utilities I use frequently after I upgraded Win 10 Pro (free offer from Asus). The amount of memory and storage is just right. I added a 128 GB SD card for extra storage (very little of it used yet)"
5.0,Good for a writer on the go,"Perfect for writing and quick internet access when you need to install your own software but don't want to shell out the big bucks for a full sized laptop.  It's lightweight, decent speakers, and fits in an oversized purse or small backpack."
5.0,Asus Vivobook E203MA,"I've had my Asus for about a month and absolutely love it. It was bought to replace an old Samsung Galaxy Tab that was mostly used for watching videos. This laptop handles video watching great Hulu, WWE Network, YouTube in the browser  all work great. Battery life is fantastic compared to my Galaxy Tab last nearly a day of use, sometimes doesn't even need a charge at the end of the day. I do keep battery saver on so that helps I believe. I was ok using Windows 10S as everything I needed was on the Windows store or could be used in the browser but I wanted to test some retro gaming, so updated easily to Windows 10 Pro for free and runs pretty smoothly. Very light and portable as well perfect size for my lap. Keyboard is great, I don't type novels but it's comfortable. Had some trouble with the trackpad skipping when scrolling however went to Asus website and downloaded all the drivers I could find as well as changed the settings, something worked cause it's not a problem anymore. Overall not a bad laptop definitely worth the money for me. It is my first laptop so don't really have much to compare it to."
5.0,Amazing Value,"I've been using small laptop computers for years, back to when they were called ""netbooks"". I'd expect speed to go up and weight and price to go down, like all electronics, but this Asus is really an astonishing value.  It's as fast as any device at surfing the web, doing email, etc., which is my primary use, AND it supports full Windows applications.  It matches my wife's $1,000 device in everything except not having a touch screen--which I really don't care about. This device is a fantastic bargain. Full size keyboard, lightening fast wifi, it's great."
4.0,Overall good deal,The AC adapter conforms to the Japanese outlet and has a PSE mark.
2.0,we bought four of these,"a year later, only two are working. seems to be motherboard issues."
5.0,"So far, more than so good!","If you are willing to do a little research and not let the computer try to tell you what to do in Windows S, the sky is the the limit here. Yes, you can upgrade to Windows 10 Pro at no cost."
5.0,Great buy,"This is a fantastic laptop for browsing the internet, watching shows, doing work, or playing older 2D and 3D games (played original Xbox’s Morrowind no problem)."
5.0,"Modern, low cost ""netbook""","I bought this small laptop to replace a ten year old Acer netbook that was used to run some tethered photography equipment. It's a nice little machine with a good screen and decent keyboard. Battery life seems to be at least eight hours. It comes with Windows 10-S installed, but the upgrade to W10 Pro is easy and free. The operating system uses up about 2/3 of the 64GB built-in storage, so adding a micro SD card (64 or 128 GB) is pretty much a given. I wish it had a backlit keyboard, but hey, at ~ $230 you can't have everything."
5.0,Loving it!,"After reading several reviews, and dismissing some as just idiocy, decided to give this one a shot. I am not sorry I did. It replaced one that I loved and had for several years. Was able to insert my files from micro sd and am back in business. This laptop is really quick and has much more storage than my previous one. No need to have external storage now. Love having such a thin and portable laptop that is 64 bit and doesn't get hot. Screen is easy to read."
4.0,Great for carrying around,"I can't tell you much about this because it was for someone else, but I helped them get it ready to use, so I can say that it was very light. It booted very fast and was easy to get ready for use. The screen seemed very nice for a laptop in this price range and size."
4.0,Great for Students,"This computer is amazing! As a student who keeps all their work on the cloud this computer is perfect. It's super portable (not taking up tons of room in my bag), has great battery life, near instant boot up (even from off) and is plenty fast for what I need. Additionally, it is great to type on. My only grievance is that the track pad leaves some to be desired, though a cheap $10 USB mouth solves that issue."
3.0,Microsoft 10 S mode-Not What I was looking for,"I ended up returning the product because the version of window’s 10 it uses doesn’t allow the download of apps other than “Microsoft approved” ones. I was unable to download Google chrome or Firefox which is more compatible with the website I use with my school website. I also had a hard time browsing the Internet with my phone hotspot connection, it was loading very slowly, if at all. It is a good size, lightweight and the quality otherwise was fine for the price. Just not what I was looking for.."
4.0,Excellent price,I bought this as secondary laptop.
4.0,Excellent for what I bought it for.,"It works fine considering it is a low cost laptop, and I bought it just to develop basic duties as Presentations, Word documents and Excel. It gets a bit slow when browsing to the web, if I open too many tabs. I can take it to my work in the morning and bring it back home by the afternoon, because it is light, small and nice. I'm satisfied with the Operating System but you will need to buy an Office license because it doesn't include one"
5.0,Easy to tuck into a bag and go.,"I use this for showing slideshows and videos to my classes. Probably wouldn't do great playing video games or anything, but for writing and internet access, it's snappy and awesome. I switched to Windows 10 pro immediately after S wasn't letting me get stuff from the microsoft store. Haven't had any issues. It's super light, which was a major selling point for me, and the keyboard is a good size."
5.0,Just get it,Loooong battery life. I’m being careful with it but it’s working amazing and I’ve traveled with it. It’s super light and fast.
4.0,Not perfect but good value for price,I’m completely satisfied with this laptop/netbook.
3.0,Great,I mainly bought this computer to connect to my printer. I don't use it for much. What I don't like is that it heats up after several minutes. But it's good for what I intended and a good backup for a second laptop.
5.0,Lol,Great for web browsing. Considering Amazon asked me if this was a good laptop for gaming is a joke. Please don't buy this for playing anything more complicated than Facebook flash games.
5.0,Lightweight laptop for casual usage,"I purchase this because this is E203MA which is using N4000 not E203NA which is still using old N3350. Pleasantly surprised to see dual-channel DDR4 ram of 2x 2GB rather than the usual single pc 4GB. Bios did not show any possible expandable slot so i guess would not have any m.2 expansion. Took quite a few tries before i successfully updated it to windows 10 1803 update. People who are complaining abt windows 10 s should read the instructions on how to upgrade to Windows 10 pro for free in the Microsoft Store. Battery Life is very long due to the energy efficient chip. overall, this purchase is definitely a good choice as my own country (Singapore) only sell the model E203NA and is more expensive than what i paid for this."
1.0,Very limited on download Apps,I bought this one for school. Very light and have a long battery life but after 3 months this laptop is dead. Does not turn on and I am in the middle of the final now. You can only download apps from Microsoft App Store which you don’t have many options. I should have bought Google laptop. I trust the company name! Do more research before you buy this one.
5.0,"Nice, light, CND",I love it. In reviews i read i saw most mention its light weight. And it is about the weight of a thin magazine and size but has what's needed. Doesn't have lots of GBs so storage gets full fast. Need to be ready and not use to keep  a lot of info or pictures etc. Load that online somewhere. I needed an emergency laptop to apply for jobs after being laid off and this is perfect and cheap for that. No complaints thus far.
4.0,Great!,"A $200 laptop that actually works really well.  Very light and easy to setup.  I brought an external hard drive just to have more memory, but that's about it.  Processing speed is not up there with the higher priced laptops, but it will definitely get the job done."
5.0,Value-for-money products,"The project is quite lightweight and the battery life is very strong, and the sound is good, but the internal data shows that Processor 1.1 GHz instead of 2.6 GHz is sometimes slow: and the visual image is narrow, but with taxes. Also less than $200: This item is great value."
1.0,Terrible product - do not purchase.,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Poor quality and poor customer service. 30 days after purchasing this laptop I got blue screen. I sent a request to ASUS and they offered to fix my laptop. I sent it off for repairs and it was returned over two weeks ago. After a few uses the blue screen happened again. At this point I am going to throw it away.
1.0,Terrible laptop,Complete garbage. Battery lasts about an hour or less. Super slow. Browser is terrible. Touch pad is terrible. I can't think of anything good to say about it. I wish I hadn't bought it or I could return it
5.0,"Computer is great, Microsoft bloatware is garbage",Perfect portable utility work computer when you just need a simple machine for the basics.
5.0,Decent little notebook for school for the price.,Good little started notebook for kids to go to school with. Windows 10 update is huge and will chew up almost all available storage when completed. Run the advanced disk cleanup utility after updates and you can regain over 20gb of storage back. Then make a backup flash drive for the just incase moments.
3.0,Dissapointed,Its a nice little computer....way to small of a screen...my phone is almost as big..its really thin...no backlit keyboard...i returned it...my i pad is better in my opinion
5.0,A Powerful little machine!,This little computer can do everything my larger Lenovo Laptop can do!  It can even update the next version of Windows 10!  I am really enjoying the little machine and it is easier to haul around than the larger laptop.  Also the battery is lasting up to 10 hours without a charge!
2.0,"Nice form factor, poor trackpad","I can't say that I got too far into using my VivoBook because I immediately ran into issues with the trackpad. Mouse inputs are completely unreliable, probably dropping 1/3 to 1/2 of my inputs. Two finger scrolling is especially bad, and requires a very specific pressure to have any chance of working. This isn't the first time I've encountered similar issues with ASUS laptops either, so I'll be moving on to another manufacturer."
5.0,Resistant. Very good battery life,I use it mostly for work. I added 4gb of RAM and replaced the hard disk with a 256gb SSD. It flyes
1.0,Waste of Money,"Arrived with a defective battery, stopped working completely after two uses. Very very disappointing."
2.0,Office Product Key NO WHERE TO BE FOUND,"The ASUS VivoBook E203MA Ultra Thin Laptop is light weight, has a good keyboard and the images are sharp.  However I have yet to be able to use the Vivo for work because the Office Product Key for the Windows 10 S Mode to get the Office system to work is no where to be found. I was afraid to use the free trial for work.  Maybe if I can give a better review when I get a working Vivo."
5.0,VivoBook,This is perfect for what I use it for. It is not a speed demon and the storage is only 64Gb but I added a 128Gb card. The price is the reason for 5 starts. IT does everything I need it do.
5.0,A little slim on resources so know why you are buying it.,No firebreather. The dual core will get you there but it won't get you there quick. I threw LUbuntu and it works flawlessly. I use it for my coding machine and then offload jobs to more beafy machines.
4.0,Best bang for your buck mini-laptop in this price-bracket. ASUS has done it again!,"Great laptop for the price, easily the best bang for your buck on the thin-laptop market."
5.0,"Very portable, with great battery life handbook","Got this little book a week ago and it works just great for me, very light, quite, easy holds in hand, outperform my transformer book Asus t200ta that I had before by much, upgraded to the Windows 10 PRO is a must though, any web tasks are handled ease, good speakers too, great computer in one word. The only thing that could be improved is a screen quality but again, it's a $200 book. Recommend for portability"
1.0,Waste of Money,"Laptop was working fine for a bit and then it does not turn on without the charger being plugged in. A week later, it doesn't even turn on anymore."
5.0,Good Power for the Price,Got this for the kids to do school work at home.  It is decently powerful for the price and the battery is long enough for them to do their schoolwork without the need to always be plugged in.
5.0,Pleased,Just what I was looking for...
4.0,Better than expected for the price,"At this price one can only expect a modest entry level device, but the E203MA has better than expected build quality. Like several other reviewers, the first thing I did was replace Windows with Linux (OpenSUSE 15 in my case). Everything worked out of the box without tweaking and the little machine just flies."
3.0,N/A,Good
1.0,Broken so soon...,"It won't even turn on, and I've barely had it!"
3.0,It gets the job done.,This laptop is good for just the basics. It has restarted a couple times by itself (I have not put it on the internet yet so it is not because of software updates). It is good for the price. (not meant for gaming).
5.0,works great,nice product.  highly recommend.
1.0,terrible,"if you want a computer that lags the first time you turn it on, and literally breaks down completely the second time you use it, this is the computer for you. also, my computer, at least, had a glitch where it was stuck in safe mode and therefore wouldn't let me download anything. totally absurd"
5.0,"excellent,seems good battery life.","Very good purchased to replace my partners old slow xp one.Very fast poss due to ssd rather than normal hard drrive,there is limited storage perhaps only 20 gb left aft all apps / up dates put on,but not an issue as only a second laptop,It comes with windows 10S which stops u installing non windows apps,but comes with a free upgrade to windows 10 pro,so all good.."
5.0,Just right!,It just right for my needs - love the size & weight.
5.0,Light and basic,"A nice quality laptop that is portable and easy to set up. I haven't tried any heavy-duty work, but it serves the purpose of everyday workload."
5.0,Powerful little Netbook,This is a great little Network to connect to remote virtual desktops.  very good battery life and does not generate much heat.
5.0,small but powerfull,"working great right out of the box, learning how too use windows 10 but should be alright"
5.0,Great!! Best value for the Money.,Laptop is great and it's best value for the price. Recommended.
1.0,Died after a week of light use.,Needed a chromebook style simple laptop but wanted windows. Loved it for a week but today it turned into a doorstop. Went to work and back in a case inside a backpack. No known hits or damage. Cant get any sign of life from it. I intend to go through warrenty process to see if i can get it replaced. Hoping mine was just a bad egg.

1.0,Didnt work had to return,Had to return it
5.0,My 2nd Asus Vivo,This is my second laptop by this brand and I love it more the my last one super light and thin I take it everywhere I go.
1.0,No value for money,Barely lasted my son 1 month at college before the power button stopped working. Multiple calls to the Square Trade Insurance resulted in messages left and no returned calls. Disgusting
5.0,Económica y útil,"Es una muy buena laptop, económica y con las características básicas que estaba buscando o mejores yo diría, la recomiendo ampliamente."
2.0,~24GB of hard drive space not 64GB,64 GB of hard drive storage is very misleading.  It's maybe 24GB after all the non-optional operating system space is taken.
5.0,Let's me do stuff,This is a good product
5.0,Cheap and great,"Good laptop, love it for the price."
3.0,Internet connection sucks,I have no other complaints for this book. Other than I bought it for working out of town and its connectability to the internet is absolutely horrible.

5.0,Five Stars,Amazing computer and perfect for our needs
5.0,Light and decent performance,"I wanted a laptop that was light, cheap and good enough to run Microsoft Office,Chrome and Spotify at the same time and play x265 video and light games (like Hearthstone, Stick Fight, Duck Game). Overall I wanted something cheap enough I could toss into my bag, treat roughly and if it got stolen at a cafe it wouldn't be the end of the world. Also, I wanted something I could type on for a whole working day without being tied to a power outlet."
5.0,Great  VALUE.,Meets all expectations.
5.0,Very Comfortable,I use this Laptop for school and it's very convenient to have this powerful computer but in a thin design!
