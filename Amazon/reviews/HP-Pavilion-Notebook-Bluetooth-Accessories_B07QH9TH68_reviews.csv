5.0,"Good Computer, just not what I wanted","This is a fine computer.  I purchased it thinking it had windows 10 professional, only to learn that it has windows 10 in S mode.  For that reason, it had to be returned.  If you don't need windows professional, then it's a fine computer."
5.0,Good Product,Very light weight. had to down load updates immediately.
5.0,Gift,Perfect gift

5.0,Very light weight,Extremely light weight works great has all the options I need for a home personal laptop. Easy setup. Appears to be a great purchase for the price.
5.0,Received as promised!,I got what I asked for and it arrived at the time it was promised.  The kit included everything I needed to get the laptop up and running.  I particularly liked the HDMI cable that was included as I also have an external monitor that I use with my laptop. This is day 2 with the new laptop and everything is good!
4.0,"Works great for what we use it for. Small games, online school, and simply daily tasks.",This computer is a good deal for the price. The computer comes in S mode that has to be removed in order to down load my internet security program. That was really annoying! Screen is smaller than I expected.
3.0,Basic Computer,"Laptops operating system could be faster. Touchscreen works well. Battery life is okay, could defintiely be better. System startup is not as fast as I had hoped."
3.0,Overall good value but know what speed you want,"Runs a little slower than anticipated but I will let my lack of knowledge share the blame for that. Overall, good value"
5.0,My MIL loves it,Good product so far.
