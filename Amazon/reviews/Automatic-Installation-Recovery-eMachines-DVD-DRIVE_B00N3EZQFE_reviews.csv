5.0,Saves time and headaches.,"I was having problems with finding all the drivers for my upgraded computer so instead of constantly searching online for a good driver install, I purchased this disk and after I put it in it only took it 3 minutes to install all the missing drivers I needed for my new and improved computer."
5.0,2018 Driver installation CD,"I have been trying for some time to bring my 8 year old Dell Inspiron laptop back to “useable” life. The Dell software “reinstallation” CD doesnt work as it should, and the system doesnt allow you to format the HD. I ordered a HD eraser and the driver CD. They both worked wonders together!! I would recommend this product to anyone."
5.0,I'd have been well and truly screwed without this. ...,"I'd have been well and truly screwed without this. FACTORY Microsoft windows 7 disks wouldn't install, right out of the box. Loaded this up, and the install went flawlessly."
5.0,Great product that performed as promised,"The disk arrived quickly and is completely compatible with the Windows 7 operating system that I had just installed on an HP computer.  Without the disk, I had no way to download any drivers to the computer and the Windows 7 DVD didn't have drivers for this particular computer.  After installing the drivers from the disk, I was able to go on line and update all the drivers and install new drivers that were needed."
3.0,Dated offering and the links to websites for addition drivers ...,Dated offering and the links to websites for addition drivers and help is down and dead. It is no help at all with Win 10
1.0,I’m very disappointed.,"I received my disk and found after loading disk, it does not work with Windows 8. I’m very disappointed."
1.0,One Star,Would not run.  Worthless.

1.0,I have a problem with the CD received. It ...,"I have a problem with the CD received. It will not run on the cover of the disk it stated that it to be used for Compaq, IBM, and e machine only when tried to down load it gave me an error message."
1.0,Return,Could not upload. I return it.
5.0,The Essentials of Windows Driver,"It works automatically & displays what it is doing. This makes it easier to determine what is going on with the computer, and, in the event of problems, to see what can be ruled out. You don't need to be online for the disk to work, which could make it easier to get online if you have internet problems."
5.0,Automatic Driver Recovery,Assists in lost drivers being restored!
1.0,This Automatic Driver Installation CD is pure junk.,"Pure Junk, I have a laptop that had not been updated since windows 10 came out, and this CD stated that everything was updated.  Big time false reporting I had to manually update all drivers and updates. This Automatic Driver Installation CD is pure junk. Do not waste your money."
1.0,One Star,Didn't seem to do anything when installed.
5.0,Does not need to connect to the internet.,I like it.  Works great.  Using it to reload win xp on a data logging industrial computer.  Thanks.
3.0,Seems Decent,"Not much I can recommend. I'm missing the network adapter/controller from the motherboard after accidentally deleting it while installing/removing a graphics card. The flash drive did a basic Windows10 driver search, but I plugged in an old WiFi USB to get online and research the fix."
5.0,Works best on windows 7,"This driver set seems seems to work best on Windows 7 machines. Restored functionality to some long dead USB ports on one machine,  improved audio on another, among several things. Does not update as well in Windows Vista or XP. In one case had to reload the Vista OS after using this driver disk. Don't know necessarily how well it works on Windows 8.1 or 10, as apparently all their drivers were up to date."
1.0,After installing the recommended drivers my system froze,"I am running Vista with home premium package, the system has never been on the internet. After installing the recommended drivers my system froze. My only solution was to do a partition recovery. I flipped my 2018 drivers CD in the trash!"
4.0,Automatic Driver,"I use it to update my Windows 7 and Windows 10 hard drivers, and like it says you don't need internet to do it. I had one driver on my Windows 7 that needed up dated. Very happy. Thank you."
