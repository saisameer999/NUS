5.0,Great Chromebook! High end features for a low price.,"For the price, this is a great Chromebook. It checks a lot of boxes and I've done my fair share of research."
5.0,Far exceeded my expectations,"Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only."
1.0,Not sure how I feel about this right now.,"Brand new device, went from 64gb out the box and after the OS update i only have 49GB available. 3.7G are in use by preinstalled apps. So you can subtract at least 15GB from the advertised 64GB description. That said, if you buy the 32GB you'll be severely disappointed."
4.0,Excellent Chromebook for the money,"I am extremely impressed with this unit. Great price, and it works really well. Nicely designed, sturdy, the keyboard and trackpad are decent. Touchscreen works well. I would highly recommend it. One thing is incorrectly described in the specifications - it says there is a microSD card slot. It is actually a SD slot. I bought a microSD card hoping to put it in and have added storage space on the go, but an SD card sticks out a lot."
5.0,The most awesomely boring device you'll ever use.,Over the period of 30-60 seconds after unboxing it for the first time.
4.0,"mediocre CPU performance, but perhaps the best Chromebook for under $300","Chromebook prices range from around $100 to over $1000. Better Chromebooks have Intel Core CPUs for great performance. The much cheaper Mediatek system in this Chromebook gives it mediocre performance, especially for intensive games or for business users who open lots of tabs simultaneously and frequently switch between them. On the plus side this Chromebook has a useful 4GB of RAM, a sharp colorful IPS screen, a touch screen that works great with Android apps, a very responsive (for swiping) touchpad, and reliable WiFi (much better than my HP laptop). On the minus side, the white plastic shell looks and feels a little cheap, the screen is not very bright, and the touchpad's button feels a little clunky. In summary, if you can't afford more than $300, this is a good choice for casual users who only have a few tabs open at once and use it mostly for email, Facebook, web surfing, and streaming music or videos. If you can afford $350 to $400, you will have several choices with more powerful CPUs for more intensive users."
1.0,Can’t Download Google Play Store App,"Do NOT buy this if you will need to download apps as the Google Play Store app can’t be downloaded on this chrome book. Internet and everything else works fine, but I bought this for my kids to play Roblox and other apps, but this particular chrome book won’t allow the Google Play store."
5.0,Best in class,"I've owned several chrome books in the past 5 years, and can say that none came close to this in term of features and versatility. Of course the display could be better but for what you use it for 95% of the time, 1366 x 768 is more than adequate. Videos are sharp and clear, document display clearly and crisp and texts are sharp on the screen."
5.0,Good value at the price for everyday use as long as you are not a demanding gamer.,"I am a big fan of Chromebooks. They update themselves, can now run at least some Google apps.  They are portable, cheap enough to haul where ever you go and fit one both airplane trays and the teeny desks they give students at college.  This one is a good value at the price for everyday use as long as you are not a demanding gamer."
3.0,"It's great, with one large caveat","Let me start off with: This is the second one of these I have had. I had to return the first one I bought, because there was a problem with the sleep and the bluetooth. Sleep, because when I would close the lid, it would just power off the device, rather than putting it in suspension. Bluetooth, because when connected to a bluetooth mouse for anywhere between 5 to 30 minutes, it will bug out and refuse to work again until it's rebooted."
5.0,My Lenovo c330  chromebook is AMAZING! 4gb RAM and 64 gb,Before I share my thoughts on the product I would like to preface with a disclaimer that I am an educator who has used Chromebooks as a tool for teaching and for my own work projects.
5.0,Fun computer to use,"Just got this after having an old Macbook Air for many years and I'm blown away. Great keyboard, touch screen works well, most websites load quickly enough and tablet mode is good for watching videos. Android apps run smoothly too, which is fun to explore if you're coming from Planet Apple. Highly recommended"
5.0,No need for a super expensive laptop,"If your needs are browsing the web, checking email, watching Netflix, there's no reason to spend any more money than what the cost of this is. Downloads and runs apps from the Google Play store super well. Keyboard is great, touchpad is lightyears better than I expected it to be with multi-touch functionality. Unless I need to run a professional software like Photoshop, I don't think I'll be using any other device on the go/around the house. Pretty lightweight, fits in a bag easily, although it's a plastic shell it seems pretty durable. This little device has far exceeded my expectations."
4.0,Great low-end chromebook for web surf,"I got my device for $200 (normal $300) on Black Friday. It has nice touchscreen, keyboard, touchpad, and type-C, USB 3.0, HDMI, blue-tooth, audio jack. Screen resolution is low but you cannot expect too much for a $200 device."
5.0,Great tablet replacement,"My Kindle Fire 10 HD response is very slow and it needs charging at least once per day. I snatched up this Chromebook when it went on sale. I like alternative (non-Microsoft) OS's. I currently use Ubuntu for my desktop. My first impressions of this Chromebook is positive. Kindle reading app works just fine. Although I don't have issues using Google Chrome browser for social media I have not had any issues with the FB Twitter or Instagram apps. I've been using this Chromebook off and on for more than a day. The battery is currently at 49% off of yesterday's charge. Although I've installed very little with no immediate intentions of installing anything else I currently have 47GB of free space left. It's small enough, and I like how I can choose between tablet to laptop. The speakers sounds better than previous laptops that I've had. It feels pretty fast (because of lack of hard drive) and responds well on my 5G wifi network. All in all I like this little thing."
4.0,Excellent value for the money!,"I'm on the second week now of using the Lenovo C330 convertible Chromebook (there are multiple models on the site under C330 so I'm specifying it is the model with 4GB RAM, 64GB SSD,  MediaTek MT8173C processor). I needed to replace my 9 year old Macbook Pro that was an excellent machine but just couldn't handle modern computing needs. However, I have a desktop for more intense computing needs, so I really didn't want to spend $1000+ on a new MacBook to browse the web, watch YouTube videos, read eBooks, watch Netflix etc in the evening. Cheap laptops in the sub $350 range are frankly almost all junk, so I wasn't really interested in buying one of those either. I don't want a tablet because I want a keyboard and I like to lie flat in bed and that's just not convenient."
1.0,Great while it worked...for all of 42 days,"If I'd written this review right after I received my Chromebook I would have said it's a great little computer for the money.  Unfortunately, it suddenly stopped working after 42 days. Amazon tech support and Lenovo tech support walked me through a few fixes to try, but ultimately the screen just wouldn't turn on."
4.0,A good computer for beginners...,"I’m definitely liking my Chromebook! I’m an amateur because my main computers have been my IPhone and IPad mini for many years and I finally decided to add a computer to my collection! It’s a great beginners computer that’s lightweight but durable! The picture and graphics aren’t great, but, ok for the work I need to get done! I wouldn’t recommend it to gamers or photographers or people looking to watch videos clearly!"
5.0,Good computer,"Great little computer for the price. This model is slightly older than the newest, so it utilizes the Play Store. This is convenient for the most part, but I have run into a couple apps that don't run right. The good part about it using the Play Store is that I can still download the various Microsoft Office programs, rather than having to add them to the browser. It is very fast. A PC with 4gb ram is not going to move as quickly as this little guy. It responds as quickly when opening programs as my 8gb pc laptop. I love it because it is small and light. It fits right into any bags I bring with me to school. It also is a touchscreen and can be used as a tablet. It should be the only laptop I need for nursing school. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a quick little, extremely transportable, computer for browsing or homework."
5.0,First Chromebook.  Very Impressed.,"Regarding Chrome OS.  This is my first chromebook so I'm still learning, but so far I'm extremely impressed!  It seems like the chromebook was the computer I've always needed but never realized I wanted!  Marrying the pc experience to an android compatible operating system is magical.  Although I'm apprehensive about this browser-based computing, I've found it very easy to save and edit documents offline so I'm still able to work on the go.  I can also connect it to my android phone, send and receive text messages with it, emulate old school video games, connect it to my bluetooth speakers and blast some jams.  I regret not making Chrome OS a part of my life MUCH sooner!"
5.0,Excellent for the price point and easy to use for 8 year old,"Absolutely love this laptop. I purchased this for my 8 yr old daughter. She loves Roblox and other games and is able to download them and play on it. Size is not too big, easy to use, and I bought the colored case and keyboard cover and it's super cute. Excellent for the price point."
5.0,"Fabulous Chromebook, but not a PC","What a wonderful computer! Like the other reviewer said: unbox, turn it on, connect wifi, sign into your Google account. That's it!"
1.0,Chromebook is bugged,After using it for an hour the mouse will start moving around erratically.  It will disappear from the screen and start randomly clicking and zooming in.  Not sure what's causing it.  I googled for help and there is nothing out there for chromebook help.  I've tried resetting.  That helped for a couple days.
5.0,Amazing Chromebook.,"I had been 'window' shopping for a chromebook for a while. I read all the information about this chromebook, the reviews from consumers across multiple vendors  and I have to say, the reviews...live up to the hype. This chromebook is amazing. The speed of the connection, the ease of use, the functionality of it and the overall design is wonderful. Because it is Google....there is a sense of trust that comes with using it. Connection to the Google Drive makes things so much easier for me since I already used it for everything anyway. The Google Office system is fabulous so I love that I have it already installed on the chromebook. I have to be honest, I'm so very happy with this purchase."
5.0,This is a great little machine!,"It just arrived today and the set up could not have been simpler.  The overall design and product is lightweight and durable.  I had a MacBook that it is about 6-7 years old.  It is starting to get slow and it has been a bit too heavy for travel.  I did not want to spend $1300++ on a new one but wanted to have a smallish lap top to travel with, every now and then I need the Internet and a Keyboard when traveling.  Also own an Ipad Air which has been great but for some business correspondence and work tasks, not ideal (i.e. sending lengthier emails, payroll,  work schedules, etc)  This Chromebook is just what I needed and the price was more than reasonable.  I would highly recommend it for someone needing more than an Ipad but not as much as a MacBook.  It also recognized all of my accounts without having to jump through hoops....So glad I found this on Amazon!  And such a great price!"
1.0,Broke WIthin 3 Months - Warranty Only Good for 1 Month,Very disappointed with this product and Amazon. Replaced my previous Chromebook in December. Now it is the end of March and the new one is not functioning.  It is not registering keystrokes - takes about 3 minutes to register the second letter of my password to log in.
1.0,One star,The prose is keep changing witch is annoying
5.0,Great little machine for the price!,"I bought this to take on a backpacking trip to Europe because I also need to do some work. I was looking for a small, lightweight machine that could access the internet and get my work done. This little machine exceeds my expectations. Solidly constructed, great keyboard, fast, display clarity. And a touchpad that works properly. I have a loathing for touchpads so the fact that I’ve been using this one all day for work and haven’t wanted to smash it is a huge plus. I’ll report back after the backpacking trip to let you know how it fared in the elements. I may have to get one for my dad."
5.0,Confessions Of An Orthodox Laptop User,"When they first came out, I was a strong critic of Chromebooks.  To me, a Chromebook was nothing more than an ADM-3A incarnate; connected to the cloud, instead of a mainframe.  But as Chromebooks started adding Chrome OS, Android and now Linux; I decided that I should get one, to carry around with me on trips; that did not require me to have access to a Windows Pro system."
5.0,This is a 200$ internet browser (that can also run android apps),"This was a very nice purchase for me as a Freshman in university. Everything I need to do on a laptop functions within the browser. Web apps are a thing in case you need certain desktop functionalities in a pinch. But I would like to reiterate: think of this as a lightweight device that runs a very optimized and very fast web browser. And I mean that; the browser on this thing can handle as many tabs as I would ever need at once. The OS itself is also smooth and responsive. This thing boots up in 5 seconds flat which is a miracle compared to windows laptops I have used in the past. Something important to note is that storage on this thing... isn't a thing. Well it is, but without a third party file explorer you are going to be using Drive as your main storage. Which is great because I was able to redeem the 100 GB free two year storage with my Chromebook. I recommend using cloud storage with Chrome OS anyway, as it will keep the operating system running quickly and it's just more convenient once you get used to maining it."
1.0,Where's the Google Assist?,"Thought this was an out of the box ready to go item. Just enter Gmail account and go. But the Chrome OS is a little funky. Tried putting on Google Assist and small notification windows came up, but another window always came up on top, so you can't read what the heck the first notification is. Never could get Assist to run and the online instructions did not help at all. I'm tech savvy, but gong to the ""dark side"" of the OS to get Canary and tweaking things is not easy functionality that was promised. Think I'll just get a google home hub. Sorry guys."
1.0,Garbage,"The first week everything worked GREAT!!!! Then the second week everything started going wrong.  I had to uninstall and reset more than 5 times, it kept freezing and the camera stopped working."
5.0,"""Upgrade"" from a Windows laptop","Firstly, my first observation is that I ordered this Chromebook from Amazon around midnight on Tuesday night and it showed up on my front porch shortly after noon on Wednesday (The next day !).  Essentially same day delivery.  Can't beat that !"
5.0,Very impressive,"My first Chromebook, but I've owned dozens of laptops, desktops, servers, tablets over a few decades. Going from a large laptop, I needed something for web apps only (email, accounting, documents, etc) and wanted something more than a tablet but less than a full blown laptop, and most important, very good battery life.  So far, I'm very impressed.  Very nice to be able to use the keyboard and touch screen at the same time (faster scrolling, etc).  Very snappy performance, plenty of room, just the right size to be portable yet large enough to be visible for older eyes.  Using for work (self-employed) so I can be in contact no matter where I am, via wifi or bluetooth tethering.  Hoping to get at least three years from it before upgrading to something faster, and it has enough speed that I think that is entirely possible.  The price wasn't my main consideration, although value was, and on that point, I feel like I've done well."
5.0,Great buy,Gift for my husband for Christmas. He loves it. He loves the touch screen and the battery life. Gets the job done!
1.0,Lenovo has the worst customer service I have ever experienced,"I  received my Lenovo Chromebook C330 and was setting it up.  I went into  settings to turn on Google play and it  wouldn't turn on.  It stated  that the administrator would not  let me have access to Google play store.  I researched online and there was little to know advice and didn't seem like a common issue.  I contacted Lenovo chat which only gave me a number and told me to press option 3.  It only had an option for 1 or 2, so I should have known how it would go.  I was  transferred multiple times, told it was a google issue, google told me it was a Lenovo issue and back and forth I  went.  So, I have returned it to Amazon and I am warning people to stay away.  I am not one to write reviews,  so know that I am extremely unhappy with this product and Lenovo's product support."
2.0,Good update to an old Chromebook. Just good.,"I had an older ACER Chromebook from 6 years ago that needed to be retired due to its limitations (but it was STILL made like a tank!), and I jumped on the opportunity to ""upgrade"" to this ASUS model. All in all, its a GOOD jump. Just GOOD."
5.0,Perfect my needs,"I've been enjoying this laptop for a few days now.  The battery life is outstanding.  The keyboard is perfectly adequate with just enough responsiveness.  The touchpad also works well.  The display is adequate.  I've enlarged the default zoom a bit to meet my particular needs.  I wouldn't recommend the display for serious photo editing, but for general web browsing it's perfectly fine.  The interface is about as straight forward as it gets.  It takes very little time to get acquainted with the OS.  As for weight, in laptop mode it's just fine.  In tablet mode, which I rarely use, it's a bit clunky.  I appreciate having a touchscreen, it makes scrolling a lot easier compared to relying on the keyboard only.  The processor speed is adequate for web browsing and so far has been perfectly satisfactory. Given how inexpensive this device is I think it's an outstanding value."
5.0,"Better than my HP. Solid, beautiful Chromebook.","I'm new to Chromebooks but not new to computers. I am an old soul who learned DOS and so I'm most happy with something like Linux and therefore the Chrome OS being based off Linux and the ability for newer Chromebooks to run Linux and open source programs like LIbreOffice are extremely important to me. I recently spilled a whole glass of wine right onto my HP Chromebook 14 therefore I had to buy a new one (even after taking the laptop apart to dry it out). This Lenovo is beautiful. The quality is far greater than the HP piles of junk out there. The screen is magnificent for such a cheap little thing. I like the fact I can use my Logitech Blutooth keyboard and therefore hopefully never spill anything again. That's the beauty of Chromebooks though - everything was backed up online and I didn't really lose much. Picked up where i left off with this wickedly good Lenovo. I have used a lot of machines - including Macs and Dell. I don't feel the price for those things are justified in anyway unless you are a full time graphics dev or designer and need heavy overpriced programs like Photoshop. There are superb alternatives with open source. Inkscape, GIMP, Scribus...and more. Cheap Chromebooks can't do everything but they are getting better all the time. I highly suggest updating Chrome when you buy this laptop, restart it then open settings and turn on Linux Beta. Learn about the programs you can run and how intelligent Linux is at installing them."
5.0,Great deal for the price and specs,"I wanted to upgrade my original Chromebook to something newer, and at the price with the touch screen, 64gb of storage, and other features this seemed like a good deal. And it certainly is!"
5.0,love it!,"Windows 10 is dysfunctional, so I stopped using Windows a little over a year ago and reformatted my laptops to Linux.  I'm fairly cheap so the laptops only cost about $350 each.  The result... SLOW.  So I bought this Lenovo instead.  I love it. Quick, no boot time, everything auto saves.  Just close it and walk away.  I use it a lot and an hour charge lasts 24 hours without having to worry about plugging it in. The touch screen is great, no messing with the track pad just scroll and click by touching the screen.  The display is fantastic - great for watching movies.  It's a tad smaller than I'm used to, but it's fine.  It has no Caps Lock Key, it is a search key instead, so I sometimes hit search on accident when I want caps lock.  30 years of typing habit."
4.0,Great Chromebook! Hard to find better for the price!,"This is my third Chromebook and so far it's been the best. Performance is very good in this price range. I have also been getting the advertised battery life and it has been great. The display also seems to be standard with other Chromebooks, but compared to my others (Dell,Asus) the colors display very well. The others had a blue tint to them that was unable to adjust."
3.0,Too many ads,Only complaint is way too many ads can’t do anything without ads popping up
5.0,Blew my mind (no seriously)!,"So, wow. I can’t find anything wrong with this machine — fast, responsive, able to run all apps I need/want, looks good, durable, awesome screen, great battery life, super fast boot, and... amazing price!? Granted this is my first Chromebook, but why have I been buying Windows and Mac laptops all these years?"
2.0,"It's a fine machine, but not worth the price.","I'm a developer who needs their machine to pull a lot of weight.  Now, these Chromebooks AREN'T made for this kind of work, so I wouldn't grade it on that.  Basically, I just needed this machine to work as a gateway to my remote machines, and for that, this worked perfectly.  It's light, quick, and simply get's the job done.  If you can keep your work limited to stuff you can do in Chrome (and *some* Android native apps), then this particular machine should be able to get the job done."
5.0,Adios iPad,It was time for new Apple because my 2012 iPad would not upgrade to IOS 11.  I heard the buzz around Chromebooks so I decided to investigate. The reviews for this Lenovo C330 were positive wherever I researched so I purchased from Amazon. It came with 64GB eMMC and 2.1Ghz processor. Same one on Lenovo.com selling for much more came with 64GB eMMC and 1.70Ghz processor !  One would think you would get a better unit from the manufacturer. After days of using this C330 I am so glad I decided to buy the C330 over new iPad. There is so much to like about it. No more spending big bucks for an Apple.
5.0,PERFECT little simple laptop for students,"So, disclaimer: I'm not a heavy computer user, meaning, all I mainly use a laptop for is browsing the web, using spotify and discord, and sometimes some Microsoft apps which i'll talk about."
5.0,Perfect Chromebook for anyone,"The screen resolution and viewing angles are amazing on this device. My daughter does her homework in Chromebook mode and she turns it into a tablet when she wants to play Android games. Performance is snappy and we have yet to see any stutters. I personally would say this is the best Chromebook you can purchase as a great value. It's inexpensive, it's high quality build, the specs and performance, and the overall appearance make this near perfect."
5.0,No Problems with adding Android apps,"I'm updating my review and giving it 5 stars now that I've played with it a few days. I'm very impressed with the Lenovo. It is my first Chromebook and after many, many years of using Windows based computers, this had been a delight to use. I haven't had any problems."
5.0,The best brand new $250 laptop.,"The lenovo c330 is an example of one of the biggest strengths of chromebooks,, excellent value. For $250 this thing is an absolute steal, it's fast, has a pretty decent ips panel and is a 2 in 1. It comes with the google play store and linux support too."
1.0,bad usb port,big problem with getting this machine fixed. We received this machine with a bad USB port-I got a hold of Lenovo-so they want me to pay to send this brand new machine back to them for repair. It is a new machine-it should not have had this problem. it is not like there is another usb port that can be used instead-ther is only 1 usb port and it is crap-just too loose to use. Too wobbly. does not work when you try to plug in a usb
4.0,Great Chromebook but with a few nitpicks,I was curious on what a chromebook had to offer since i never used or owned one and i'm in need of a laptop since i'm living somewhere else.
4.0,It's a pretty solid Chromebook with it's cons + pros,Pros: The Chromebook is snappy and fairly fast. It's a very stylish and light weight device on the go. The Chromebook offers the google play store and touchscreen is handy with apps. The screen quality is great enough to read books clearly for a long period of time.
5.0,"Goodbye for now, MacBook Pro!",I've had this just over a week. I am loving it. The keyboard is reminding me so much of my Mac. Nice and smooth
3.0,build quality issues?,"Overall I cant recommend this chromebook. The price is attractive for what you get but I had 2 before deciding thats  just not enough. The first one when I opened it, it had a super small crack right in the middle of the screen lid, so small that had the case not been white I would have not noticed it. When I did, I attempted to scratch it off with my fingernail thinking it was just a mark, it wasn't and I was honestly ok with it because how small it was. Well, it spread and got significantly bigger to the point I decided I best exchange it.  Second unit arrives and everything looks good, I get it all set up and begin using it. Its almost* decent, stutters here and there but doable until I grabbed a few lightweight games from the market and it had a hard time with much of anything. On to linux apps, as this computer supports them and same thing as the market, just too much for this computer. If you only want to browse the web then I think this will do you ok, little dropped frames on video etc but ok, anything more and you might want to reconsider. This chromebook comes with a mediatek processor  which is about on par with lower classed intel celerons etc, great for price, battery useage but pretty bad for the consumer."
5.0,Great for student /college student,"This is a great Chromebook for a student or college student! It’s not too heavy and it’s super easy to setup ! All you need is a gmail account ! Also they battery life on this is amazing , I have had it unplugged all day and I’ve yet to run out of battery ! I would highly recommend it to anyone needing a small computer!  I haven’t run into any problems! They picture quality is pretty good but sometimes some things are kinda pixelated! Overall I would say I love this Chromebook!"
4.0,Using the up down arrow keys to scroll..,"I like the fact that it's like one big phone. You can download your apps, and if You dont want to use as a laptop you can fold it and use it as a tablet. Also great for school i got this lapto because i am taking online classes. Wifi works great, the only thing that i had a problem with is scrolling down on the screen. I was use to just hovering the cursor over the side of the screen. But end up just using the up down arrows to scroll, And it would be best to get a wireless mouse. Other than that great lap top. (Update) i literally just found out you  can scroll up and down the screen in laptop form just by touching the screen. It doesn't have to be in tablet form to do so, and you don't have to just use the up down keys..had a blonde moment.. in other words just continue to mess around and play with your laptop lol"
4.0,Mixed results but no hard feelings,"I've been an enthusiastic chromebook user for many years.  I dumped a glass of wine on my 5yr old asus and it was time to update.  The Lenovo c330 is a beautiful machine. Fast, great battery life, really loved the 360 hinge.  It worked great as a touch screen tablet. Awesome colors and sharp clear images on the screen. I liked my new lenovo so much I bought for my kid as he turned his old asus into a linux/unbutu machine so he could practice coding."
5.0,So far it's proven to be a nice little machine,"Disclaimer: I'm normally a die-hard Mac person. But I'm also a middle school teacher. And if there are two things that do not go together, it's an expensive personal computer and over 100 twelve to fourteen year-old kids. So I decided now was as good a time as any to use some of my saved-up Amex points to get something that I wouldn't be *that* bothered by if the kids accidentally knocked it off a table or dropped something on it. I mean, they're middle-schoolers so they're not exactly known for their agility and grace."
4.0,My wife likes it..,"We really like the wide viewing angle good sound system . Younger people may not appreciate that as much as we do because our hearing & sight is not as good as it was many years ago,  Resolution could be better but for the most part is easy to see and hear."
5.0,Great as a bedside device,"I bought this to replace a Google Home (GH) ""Smart Speaker"" on my bedside table. I leave it plugged into the wall. You can turn on ""Goggle Assistant"" so that you can ask questions and get audio answers w/o pressing a button. Unlike the GH (and other ""smart speakers"") you have full access to the web, email, movies from Amazon and Netflix, radio stations (via TuneIn, etc), your calendar, phone calls (via Google Voice), and a myriad of other applications (via Google PlayStore). In my bedroom it replaces the Amazon Echo too. If I were to use it as a (portable) laptop/tablet it would be fine for that as well. Frankly, I don't know why anyone would buy any other device for their bedside table (and I have looked at more than one)."
5.0,Great buy!!!!,For what I paid for this I should have bought 2!  This thing is extremely useful.  Great battery life and my daughter uses it for school work.  Outstanding purchase!
2.0,LeNOvo C330,"Stay away. Keyboard stopped working twice in first 3 weeks (spacebar, z,x,c,v keys). Returning."
5.0,Excellent,"Got this for my mom. I had bought her 1st Chromebook 4 or 5 years ago. Everyone in the family attacked me for having done that at the time. I coached her and all went great. So I just replaced that one with a newer and more slick model. She uses it for surfing the web, emailing, watching movies and loves it. The self standing mode to watch movies without seeing the keyboard is a plus. I may get one for myself too."
5.0,Like Wow!,"I've had a few chromebooks including the C720, the Asus Chromebook flip C101PA, and I have a chromebook at work. But this one easily tops them all. The screen is awesome and bright. Very colorful. It seems to be built well. It has a touch screen and can fold into tent mode as well as tablet mode. The keyboard is spacious and easy to type on and the trackpad is large and works well. I tested some Google play apps against my daughter's new Macbook pro and my chromebook opened all the apps faster. I have Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Officesuite, Onenote, and some games downloaded (not web based). Then we tested our internet speed on Xfinity's site and I finally beat her multiple times. What would I change? The large bezels around the screen could definitely be smaller, and perhaps a lit keyboard. That's really about it. I love this thing but the best part of all, the price. It's about 1/5th the price of my daughter's macbook pro and we're doing pretty much the same things. Great deal."
5.0,Works perfectly for me,"I have several window computers, two tablets, a kindle and 2 phones.  After doing my income tax return on my Windows computer I got so frustrated with Windows 10 and printing issues I decided to look at Chromebooks.  After researching I purchased this Lenevo because of the ratings and the 60gb hard drive.  I received it quickly and had it set up in no time.  I synced it with my phone and tablet and it is great.  The battery life is amazing and the multi-position screen can't be beat.  The screen size and keyboard are the perfect size for me.  I haven't encountered any issues and am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend to others looking for an inexpensive alternative to Windows or Mac laptop."
4.0,"Good, not great",First week with this Chromebook.
5.0,Good laptop for price; good battery life,"Some pros: For the price, this laptop is great for internet browsing and if you have a google/gmail account, you can connect everything to it.  I use google photos on my phone, so it was great to have the photos back up into the laptop with just a push of a button.  There was also a promo that came with extra space on the google drive for 2 years when I bought this chromebook.  The touchscreen works pretty well, although not as smooth as iPad/iphone level, but i was able to use Adobe Sketch and Whiteboard apps when I needed to ""draw"" for my class or studying."
5.0,Sleek and fast!,"Love this chrome book only wish I could download explorer so I could use it for work and play but still great little sleek!  I was able to purchase Microsoft 265 aps for the cloud so that works great and was really affordable, plus I already use a lot of google sheets.  Certainly pleased with this purchase so far.  If anything changes I'll update my review.  But for now, I recommend."
5.0,You get a little more than you pay for . . . a little,"I bought this thing (typing on it at the moment) after my Macbook Pro died. It's obviously not a replacement for a real machine, but I needed something to kind of bridge the gap while I saved for a new, fancier product. For the price, I think it's a great choice. I haven't experienced any lag with videos, and my guess is that if you do, it may be because you're asking this little machine to do work above its pay grade."
4.0,"Huge bezel, otherwise it's great.",My first chromebook. For the price I have no regrets at all.
5.0,"Very nice inexpensive Chromebook, performs very snappy","This is a nice nappy little Chromebook for such an inexpensive price. I got it on sale for $229 and I really can't believe how good it is for that low price.I got my first Chromebook many years ago and then had an Acer Chromebook 13 for four years. It finally fell off the coffee table one too many times and crack the hinge. Was looking for another inexpensive one to take its place and this one works great. The touch screen is very responsive and is bright and colorful. For the price point on this one, getting a 360 hinge is quite a bonus. Battery life is excellent. I have it set to sleep mode when I close it and it doesn't really seem to use any battery when it's that way. The keyboard is very nice and the track pad works really well. I usually have five or six tabs open and it performs just like if I only had one open. All in all I'm pretty darn impressed with this Chromebook for it's inexpensive price point."
3.0,Meh,I was excited for this product but it feels cheap and it was coming apart
5.0,Amazing value for price!,"Way worth the price! Was worried about the processor, but it is perfectly zippy! I can’t believe it didn’t cost more. Works perfectly for our kid to do her school homework/apps/ and web based programs, without us worrying she will destroy our computers. Love that it supports android apps through the google play store. Schools use those apps and Chromebooks in class.  Creating a kids google account was tricky as web based instructions are outdated and inaccurate. Would be nice if those instructions were included with unit."
5.0,Amazing Machine,"I mean it's a Chromebook, they are the only computers I buy at this point but seriously a touchscreen to boot for $200?!? This thing is awesome! Only downside is that I find myself trying to scroll down like a touchscreen on my work HP computer because that feature makes getting work done so very seamless. This unit is durable as I use it every day in my PE class to take attendance, gather data for grading and fitness tests and work the remainder of the day with Athletic Admin details without having to charge it but once a day.  It also allows a lot of my Google Play apps to download since it doubles as a tablet in flipped mode. I have used this paired with my Bluetooth devices to do indoor bike training and it works like a charm to record workouts with a much better screen to read than my phone."
5.0,Perfectly portable!,"After a failed attempt at purchasing a similar model from Newegg, I decided I would try to buy a Chromebook from Amazon. I usually avoid purchasing computer-related items from here due to the terribly lacking search option but I admit I was so disappointed by Newegg that I turned a bit desperate."
5.0,Clean and sleek looking laptop/tablet at an great price.,"I don’t write many reviews, but when I do...it’s for something really awesome or really terrible. Well as you can tell by the five stars above my review, Lenova/Chromebook knocked it out of the park on this one."
5.0,Chromebooks Rock!,"This is my second Chromebook. The first one lasted six years and never gave me a problem. I just updated because I wanted to touch screen and the folding setup of this device. The screen is very crisp the keyboard is responsive and I love the touch feature and when I fold the screen over to read or show someone video. And of course there's never any problem with the software since there is no OS, just the chrome browser which does it all.  Fast and secure. Love it"
5.0,"Great Value, Also Works Extremely Well","I haven't touched a Lenovo product in years. But good reviews made me give this a try. Having owned a few Chromebooks and Android-centric devices - I can say I really like this laptop/tablet hybrid device. I like the size, feel and quality. In particular, keyboard and trackpad feel great. The flexibility to flip it over and use as a tablet was really nice. I was also able to install from the Android Play Store getting some apps I prefer to have on this form factor. The battery has been long-lasting. The screen is responsive to the touch and very clear to read text and see video. I am not sure I have any complaints yet. To be picky - the bezels are a little big but that's because I am looking at the industry trend to eliminate bezels. Which I don't agree with... So really not a thing here. Recommend..."
1.0,Total brick in less than three months,"Bought for grandkids for Christmas and it was dead before spring.  Battery failure.  Seller will not return and will not support.  I was shocked to discover such a short warranty window (two weeks by the seller), but my bad for not checking.  I'll certainly never buy another Lenovo product again."
2.0,Google app for  Google home app and devices,"The Google app (white icon colored G) is NOT compatible with this  Lenovo C330 ,big deal? only if you want full compatibility to control your Google home devices, this is a chrome book with the new android apps from Playstore  built in. You cant install the Google Assistant,it requires updating from the Google app-- the Google Home can be installed but is NOT fully functional( like personal voice identification) without the Google app. They only mention  that not all android apps are functional- this issue in NOT mentioned anywhere . Overall not a bad machine and the price is right, but not if you WANT TO JOIN THE 21ST CENTURY SMART HOME !  lOOKS LIKE CRAIGSLIST FOR ME@ FOOLED AGAIN. Bye the way i called and confirmed this with Lenovo."
5.0,An Excellent Chromebook,"I am thoroughly enjoying this Chromebook.  I previously owned the Asus Chromebook Flip 4GB.  I've had it for four years now, and I still love that Chromebook.  I passed it on to my 9-year-old son."
5.0,"great price, great buy","I had been searching laptops for some time.  Decided because of pricing to go with a chromebook if it came in a decent price.  This one hit what i was looking for...flip screen, touch , battery life and sleek looking.I love the white.  The only complaint i might have is the screen is not always responsive to tabs, that seem to be in one top area of the screen.  its not enough to return it, but definitively something is off in that area.  The battery life is great.  I also ordered a bag/pouch to put it in but not keen on that order.  still searching for something that fits this chromebook better.  I would suggest something from the seller and not a amazon ""others have bought""  Great chromebook for the price."
5.0,Very happy and yes Play Store is available,Extremely impressed with this device. I bought this to replace a different brand tablet that drove me absolutely insane since the first day I bought it.
5.0,Great machine for android computer use!,"i bought this to watch tv, use android apps, and play games"
4.0,Great Buy at the Price,"Overall, I'm more than happy with this laptop. I do NOT recommend it for gaming, nor was it intended as a gamer's computer. But for my online reading tasks (NOOK and Kindle) and the sustained viewing of sites like Youtube, this is a tremendously good buy, I think. The internal speakers are not so great, but it's snap to plug in auxiliary speakers which do perform very well. I was not ready for the Chrome OS (didn't actually know it existed!) and made a few silly attempts to install various windows applications which were rejected, but when I figured that out, all was sweetness and light. For those wanting a solid and reliable computer for average daily browsing and so on (at low virus/malware risk, too), I don't think you can beat it. I do recommend it."
4.0,A decent netbook with Pros and Cons,"I don't know why they call this a laptop instead of a netbook - regardless, I've listed some pros / cons that might help you out:"
4.0,Some things better and some things not better than my old Acer R11,"I had had my Lenovo Chromebook C330 a couple of weeks now, I bought to replace my old Acer R11 which soldiers on after an encounter with a spilled adult beverage,"
5.0,Excellent Chromebook and does everything I need from writing two social media,"When my MacBook died and I didn't want to put out another $1,500, this was recommended. At this price, $250, it's an amazing deal and it's faster than my old MacBook. The screen is responsive and bright, and chrome OS does everything I need it to. I now write all my journalism stories in Google docs which I can access offline as well. An excellent choice and well worth the money."
5.0,Great inexpensive Chromebook,"Although I ultimately returned this due to my personal experience with ChromeOS, the unit itself has a very good cost to features ratio. Quality build, nice touchscreen, lightweight, responsive touchpad, etc. Indeed it does run Android Play Store apps! If you can get this for $220 (as I did) it's a no-brainer if a Chromebook is what you seek."
2.0,Returned it after long internal debate,I really wanted to like this product but in the end had to return it. I did everything to keep it. The product is built with sturdy plastic material that would have fooled me as something else. The display is great under normal\typical conditions. The OS is super fast and you can use google play and Linux etc. Tons of storage about 49 GB available. The hinge felt good. I used it everyday and stop using my now 7 year old windows 10 i3 laptop. What went wrong. Well the screen display was good but it was a little too small at 11.6 inches. The really bad part was the Bluetooth issues. When using Chromebook in laptop mode i use a Bluetooth capable mouse which often stop working randomly for no apparent reason. The Bluetooth would stop responding and once turned off not work again until you power cycled the system. I tired everything to resolve the issue including powerwashing it which is a hard reset to factory. Nothing resolved it. I called tech support and they scripted me. Asked me to powerwash it and then asked me to send it in for motherboard replacement which had a turn around of 9 business days... That is when i decided it was time to let go and return this Chromebook. I highly recommend Chromebooks just not this one. Maybe spend a little more and get something of higher quality if want to use all features especially Bluetooth.
5.0,very impressed!,"This came to me fast and beautiful.  I've only had this today but have used for hours already and no sign of battery usage at all.  I couldn't be more pleased with this computer.  I have another ""chrome"" as well and it is great too but this one blows the other away with no buffering so far at all with many things i have open.  Im happy :)"
1.0,worked good for about 6 month,The viewing screen partially detached from the keyword.  This has caused a problem in  being unable to access my documents.  After six months I feel this is unreasonable to have to purchase a new product.
5.0,Absolutely the best Chromebook.,"Stop looking around at Chromebooks. This is the one to get! Had a Samsung 3 and a Lenovo S330, sent back. This is perfect! Great screen, great viewing angles, touchscreen, and will fold as a tablet. Great battery life also. Honestly, try others first, you will love this tablet, almost like it better than my MacBook Pro for everyday use. I use this in a non business form."
1.0,This has been a big headache.,The touch screen was always freezing up. There are lot of app said still can't be downloaded to a Chrome book I didn't realize this . And now the whole thing is frozen. The touch screen doesn't respond the keyboard doesn't respond I can't even turn it off I have to wait for the battery to run out.  This Chrome book was delivered on January 17th.  I am so so disappointed.
5.0,Just saved about $300,"Why buy new when this was like new, Honestly except for the packaging I couldn't tell you it wasn't new. My wife uses this for college mostly, it helps her do her writing assignments while still keeping tabs on the little demons we have running around. It is a great tablet/laptop it has its limitations but I didn't purchase it expecting it to replace my desktop with dual monitors. Just to do some writing assignments and general browsing. At which it excels. And it's a Chromebook so Google Docs and Drive help keep all the projects centrally located between the computers."
5.0,"Five stars, even from an Apple fanboy","I've been all Apple since my first iMac DV in 1996... I had to use Windows products here and there for work, but I never liked them. I was looking for something similar to a netbook but I wanted more performance, a better touchscreen and keyboard and, more than everything, speed and storage. This Chromebook is the perfect package, with 64Gb of memory and a OS that is sight and fast. I love the fact that can download and run most Android apps, including Netflix (so I can download movies and watch them while I'm on a plane without connection). I also use it to read my Kindle books and for that price... I can even break it or lose it without being too upset. It charges thru a regular USB-C port, so you can even use a battery pack or the outlet in your car."
5.0,Great Chromebook!,"This Lenovo Chromebook C330 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop worked wonderfully on my cross country flight.  The battery did not deplete.  Screen sharpness is excellent.  Does what is advertised. Easily hook up to the internet using your google account or sign in as a guest to surf, which is a better option for security in a hotel.  Light weight and easily fits into a small backpack.  I would purchase this again if needed."
3.0,Not impressed,Well my overall impression of this is ehh. It works. But after a couple weeks of using it seems to just get bogged down. I continually clear out history files and I really haven’t installed any crazy apps.
5.0,"Great Chromebook, excellent price!","Great Chromebook, excellent price!  It performs awesome and the battery lasts all day. This device is comparable to a 5 or 600 dollar 2-in-1, with the exception of lower screen resolution.  Unless you are accustomed to a 1080p laptop, you will never know the difference."
5.0,"Best laptop bang for your buck, full stop","This was my first Chromebook, and I wasn't sure if it would suit my needs. For 99% of it, it was just phenomenal. Snappy performance, android apps worked great, battery was otherworldly. I had some issues with office software needs, though, and decided to get a Chromebook with more oomph so that i could run Linux apps on it. If it had Linux support i'd have kept it."
1.0,Not made to last,Died after 40 days. Lenovo support is atrocious. They try to do anything and everything to not create a repair request. Took three phone calls. Now I have to ship the unit to them at my cost for repair even though it’s warranty.
5.0,Better than a tablet,"I bought this for a new cloud based application we are using for work that works best on chrome. I switched out the tablet I was using for this and it has been great. I love it, best decision so far this year. Not only does it run the app really well it does most everything else I was doing on my tablet and PC really well."
5.0,Fantastic for the Price!,"I mostly use this to read books/comics, stream movies/tv, write books, scroll through the internet, and play low space games from the playstore. If you're into that kind of stuff, I recommend this laptop 100%."
5.0,"Simple, no fuss streaming","Love it so far! It's fast, easy to use especially if you're familiar with Google products and screen resolution is very crisp. I use it for streaming and for work as a real estate agent. I can access my MLS and all my apps on this Chromebook, making it a more functional option than my smartphone because of its keyboard + larger screen as well as a more portable, lighter alternative to my laptop. I like how it can be used as a laptop and a touch screen tablet depending on how you fold it. Recommended if you need a simple device for streaming and browsing. Also great for jobs that require a portable way to access internet (as long as there's wifi availability)."
4.0,Screen glare and not backlit,Update: I am using the screen filter and now I really love this little Chromebook.
5.0,A great BYOD option for school,"After breaking two Dell 13"" Inspiron notebooks, we decided to try a Chromebook fir the kIds' BYOD.  Turns out, the Chromebook has better battery life and is lighter than a regular PC, with no reduction in capability for school-related tasks. A lit cheaper too!"
5.0,Battery life for days!!,"I literally only charge this baby once every three or four days and I am constantly online doing my college classes. I love this chrome book! I don’t like how forceful I have to be for the touch screen to work, but I love most everything else! And very affordable!"
4.0,Amazing experience,"This is my first chormebook experience, my decision to switching from windows to chormebook was not easy and of course  i was worried, but to my amazement the performance of Lenovo C330 is best, this chrome book suffice for my use which consist of browsing, wathcing youtube, netflix and for writing purpose. Even i can downloand musics, movies and ebooks. overall very satisfied with a budget chormebook."
5.0,"Great ""laptop"" for college","Got this as a Christmas present for my wife who never has had a ""nice"" laptop and she loves it so much!  It flips between tablet and laptop easily. For these past 4 months has worked great as a simple college laptop or a convenient way to watch netflix in bed on a screen that's bigger than your phone.  Just remember, this is a chromebook, not some high powered gaming laptop."
5.0,Awesome for the price.,For the price I paid on “Black Friday” this thing is amazing! Touch screen! Great battery life! Extra memory so you can download movies from places like Netflix for road trips! It’s not a computer if your wanting to load a lot of programs buy a computer.
5.0,Chrome OS has came a long way.,"I was kinda skeptical about buying any sort of chromebook rather than a traditional laptop. Seeing how I already have a gaming desktop I spend majority of my computing time on, I only wanted a laptop to do some school work on and stream media from the comfort of my bed. I have to say, at least for my use case, this thing is quite nice. I can recall having chromebooks for students in school to use and they were headaches. Long story short, Chrome OS has come a long way."
4.0,A steal at this price,"For $250, it is a steal. I always find a chromebook best computer for non-professional + non-gamers. Fast, easy to maintain and inexpensive. This one also have the quality to become a tablet, if you feel like it. Given that Android Apps are becoming available more and more on chromebooks, it's utility is increasing. So, full points on that."
5.0,Seriously Pleased,"I don't typically leave reviews, but this one is worth it!  The Lenovo C330  has exceeded my expectations. The screen is not full HD but it's bright and clear enough for apps and Netflix. The setup is crazy simple and integration with the Pixel 3 is handy. Battery life (with average use) has been around 8 hours."
5.0,im very happy with my purchase,"so far only 1 problem, my power supply quit in the first week of ownership. 15 minutes later a quick call to support and a new one is on its way to me. i love how fast it boots, i hesitated for a long time about buying a chromebook. i love it, easy to understand settings."
5.0,Great for school/studying,Starts up really quickly (takes no more than 10 seconds to go from powered off to being able to start working on your stuff. Can have multiple tabs open with out any issues. Think I’ve had 15 browser tabs open and was able to video chat out an issue.  There isn’t a bunch of storage 64GB can go pretty fast if you’re not paying attention but if you’re just using If for school and maybe some light work/office stuff you should be ok. I love that is a 2 in 1 so that I can use it as a tablet for reading text books. It’s touch screen also makes it really and convient to navigate through various screens. It’s also fairly small 11.6 inches so it fits in to bag backs without being too bulky. You will need an internet connection as most of the features offered are accessed on line. Probably should pass on this if you need something with a lot of memory or for gaming though.
4.0,Worth the money w/ a caveat,"If you're looking to get a reasonably priced laptop, this would be a great consideration!! The only issue that I find annoying is that out of the box, due to it using the ChromeOS (Operating System), you are not able to use the vast majority of applications created for Windows. You are able to use certain Windows applications like Microsoft Word, Excel, etc. I should note that there are ways to get around this, but as I said out-the-box you will not have that capability and if you are not a tech savvy person, you could have difficulties figuring out the ways around this issue. With that being said, this would be a great basic laptop for a college student or someone using it for basic internet necessities."
5.0,Great Chromebook,"The boot-up time, battery life, simplicity, and convenience are excellent. It checks all the boxes of what you'd expect from a chromebook. The only knock against it is that the touch screen takes a more deliberate/firmer touch than a tablet, smartphone, or even the windows laptop with a touchscreen that we have. However, it doesn't bother me at all because I never use the touchscreen on laptops."
4.0,"Lenovo C330 ""Surprise Performance""","I purchased the C330 mainly to see if I would be able to function using a Chromebook OS for my mobile comp. needs. Have used Windows laptop for mobile the last few years and wanted to try something different. I mostly use it to browse the internet, read news magazines like Flipboard or Google News, or watch videos. I also enjoy being able to use Android apps from the Play Store. I have been pleased with the processing speed, IPS touchscreen, trackpad operates smoothly, and keyboard is just fine.  Also enjoy having the extra storage at 64gb.  At this price point, have been surprising pleased with overall performance."
5.0,"C330, My one more choice of Chromebook","I'm using Acer R13. This is good for FHD(1920x1080) resolut. But a little big size and heavy weight. Not for portable. So I bought chromebook again. Compared with Lenovo C330 and Acer R11. Finally my decision was C330. Cause of quad-core CPU and 64GB storage, 4GB Memory and not expensive prive."
5.0,Best convertible,"Perfect replacement for an iPad and laptop for most purposes. Long battery life, easy to use."
4.0,Runs Android apps. Flips completely around.  Watching streaming can be sometimes be frustrating,"Very good value.  Only downside I've found is streaming on Directv Now slows down regularly.  My other, more robust laptop has no issues with this.  I've tried with browser and with Android app.  Android app wasn't slow but had issues with sound.  Usually other streaming sites are fine.  I think I had trouble just a few times with Amazon."
5.0,Good alternative for kids.,"I bought this as an alternative for my 2 and 4 year old kiddos not taking our phones to use various Android applications like Starfall, Kahn Academy for Kids, nickjr, YouTube kids and Disney now.  Rotating the screen around keeps the keyboard down and they use as a standing tablet."
5.0,good cromebook,"slow at first ,but update takes care of that. do update as soon as you can,after that it is very fast, and has decent battery life"
4.0,Battery Life is amazing but I've had issues with the Screen and Trackpad,"This affordable Chromebook was purchased to be my travel work computer and it has been great thus far for that purpose. I'm able to do work in Google Docs and email throughout my trips, but I have had issues with the left top corner of the screen being blurred for some reason when I'm in Chrome's browser. The trackpad has also had a few issues, but they aren't as consistent as the screen issues."
5.0,A lot of laptop for the price,"This machine is easy to set up and functions both as a laptop and a tablet. My wife is not strong technically, so it has been good to see her getting on so well with this machine.  It remains to be seen how durable it will be as it is lightly built and switching from laptop to tablet and back is bound to put strain on the components. However, I hope she will get prolonged use out of it."
1.0,Broke after a month,After a month of use the computer display the black screen of death and could not be saved. Of course it’s outside the return window for 30 days so I can’t return it and it doesn’t work :-(
5.0,Powerful Chromebook for little $,Overall I really like this Chromebook. I have a range of devices for work related purposes and a Chromebook was one I didn’t have. I’ve seen many comments about no Play store. To confirm - this device (purchased April 2019) does have full play store access. I’ve been using it for two days and I’m enjoying it.
5.0,Top quality!,This is a top quality computer. High quality build. It reminds me of an apple but for half the price.
5.0,LOVING THIS CHROME BOOK !,"This Chrome Book  Laptop is much more than I expected... Lenovo has made things easier. The size the quality  is so great for Traveling, I travel a lot , it also manages my files and has a great file system. If I am in need of  other programs such as adobe , it is connected to google play where i find most things free. With the ability of the Google Play apps, I save on file space  because everything is run through google system!"
3.0,Randomly shuts down,"Overall it's a good laptop but I've had issues - It randomly shuts down when it's asleep and I'm unable to connect it to my wireless printer or wireless speakers. With that said, the battery life is amazing. I can finally work at coffee shops!"
5.0,Great Little Laptop,"I luv luv luv this Lenovo Chromebook.  It is extremely quick, has everything I need (am no techni) love  the touch screen.  Only very small complaint...it is a little heavy.  I highly recommend."
5.0,My work gave me one. A year later i got this for my kids,"I had a different chromebook for work that i left in my office. One day i came into work and noticed a small ding on the top corner. It still Works but when the humidity gets high the touch screen goes crazy. My IT department gave me one like this so it would bemore dependable and they we're right. It's solid, strong, and it seems like i only charge it every other day."
5.0,Awesome convertible!,"Overall I love it, esp for the price. I mostly use at laptop, but so nice to have the touchscreen / tablet option too!  I would maybe prefer the screen be detachable, not because it’s bulky but I do worry a little about pressing on the keyboard when it folds around."
4.0,Very Nice,"I've only had this up and running for a few days but I am impressed.  This is my first lap top of this kind and it seems much easier than what I have had before, Windows and Mac.  I did not give it the fifth star only because I have not been using it long enough too but I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this item."
5.0,Great budget laptop!,"It's it a five star laptop overall? No. For the price is it five stars? I think so. Good screen,  battery life, touch screen and once you learn a little about Chrome OS (great YouTube videos) then it can do things much more costly laptops can do. Definitely worth a look!"
5.0,My new favorite device.,"I am delighted, even though Amazon took 24 hours to get it to me (LOL). This is my first chromebook and I was a bit leery, especially given the low price. Speed and battery life greatly exceed expectation. Screen quality meets my expectation. Ease of use exceeds expectation. I have several computers and 4 tablets, but the C330 is now my favorite device."
4.0,For its Price it's Great,"It lags a little in it's touch screen response.  I love tablet's.  I'm an Androidphile.  This was the least expensive way for me to have a Tablet.  And I got an extra laptop in the deal.  Sadly, not all developers have come on board for the Chromebook OS as yet.  Some of my favorite apps are not compatible.  As a ""cord cutter"" I use it to watch shows and cast them to my TV's, which have Chromecast's attached to them.  All in all, it was worth the price I paid."
5.0,Replaced my iPad at a fraction of the price,"This is a great little device for streaming, doing email, and accessing the internet. I have been able to easily convert Excel to Sheets which is great for work. It seems to do everything an iPad can do at a fraction of the price. Obviously won’t take the place of my laptop but it’s great to have along when traveling. Lightweight and compact enough to fit in a smallish backpack. Charges quickly and battery life is more than adequate so far."
5.0,Love this Chromebook!,"I didn't know whether I'd like this as much as my laptop, but it's great! Perfect small size for travel, as fast as my laptop, and lightweight. It is hard to find a sleeve that fits though - the 12.5"" version of this one fits pretty snugly: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQIDT24/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
