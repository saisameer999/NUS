5.0,This is a solid laptop but on the heavy side,"I upgraded this refurbished unit up to 32 GB memory and replaced the 512 gig ssd drive with a 1 TB ssd drive and reinstalled windows 10 pro, this brought the laptop up to today's standards at a lower total cost then buying a new high-end laptop. The Intel Core i7-4900MQ is a i7 4 core processor that will meet most any needs that only a hard core adobe premier user might push it's processing power."
5.0,Beast Mode!!!,Fast delivery. Fast response.
3.0,Great PC with Problems,"I love this laptop, but I have had a few problems. After a week, the screen has started going black after closing and reopening the lid. I have tried a lot of troubleshooting advice to no avail, such as updating video drivers and flashing bios. I have just tried one more thing (updating chipset driver), so hopefully that fixes it. The computer also wasn't recognizing SD cards, but after updating the mentioned driver it does. I love this PC and want to keep it, so I will try to get it to work, as the seller does not do replacements, only refunds, and the price has gone up $50 since I bought it. If the problem goes away I will gladly raise this to a 5 star review; if not, I will lower it and return the product."
5.0,Cost Effective well performing windows 10 box,I was going to build a desktop but just the cpu cost more than this laptop. no hassles starting it up. it comes registered as win 10 pro. I plan on using it for writing code
5.0,Your mileage may vary,"With multiple sellers, and probably with the same seller your machines configuration may vary.  However I was extremely pleased with my laptop."
5.0,Almost new.,"I wanted a computer to run Fusion 360 and needed real horsepower and good graphics.  This computer has exceeded my expectations .  Works perfectly and looks lightly used.  Battery works well, almost 4 hours while running fusion 360 and watching videos at same time.  This is a heavy weight and heavy duty unit designed for commercial use.  All aluminum case and a really smooth keyboard.  The wifi is amazing in this computer, it has full strength and great speed in the same places my cell phone and chromebook frequently loose connection."
5.0,Looks and performs like new.,"They must have installed a new keyboard and did other things to it because although it's a refurb, it looks brand new.  No dead pixels either.  Outperforms my new $1000 Lenovo work laptop in all areas except disk which is expected because this unit comes with rotating media which does not matter to my son because he's playing games on it; the Nvidia helps a lot.  This was a great purchase.  Can't beat the price vs. performance ratio."
5.0,"the laptop is clean looks like new, works just fine",thank you very much
1.0,"Could be excellent, but it wasn't",I bought the model with i7-4900MQ Processor but it came with i7-4810MQ :(
5.0,Great budget computer. Well worth the cost.,This is a Great machine for the people on a budget. This computer saved me over $1000. The graphics are pretty good I’m even able to play some of the most demanding games. Shipping was quick and it came packed in bubble bag this thing could’ve been dropped from 3-5 stories and survived the fall. I had to call them to find out how to activate the Windows 10 but then I read the slip they sent with the computer. They were very helpful and professional on the phone even though I was calling to ask a question they had already answered. It helps to read before you call.
1.0,Keyboard began to malfunction,"Worked well enough for nearly two months. Then suddenly the keyboard cutout while I was typing up a document. If the computer was restarted I could occasionally type my password in before the keyboard would die. Once or twice I'd restart it and the keyboard worked for 2-3 minutes before cutting out again. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling drivers which did nothing. On one of the better restarts I was able to get into the bios settings and fiddle around but I wasn't able to do that again later, this lead me to believe it wasn't some kind of software issue if the keyboard was acting up before windows initialized."
5.0,I have owned 4 laptops in the past. This machine is by far the best laptop I've ever had!!!,"When I took this Dell laptop out of the box it appeared to be brand new. What a fabulous refurbishment job was done on it.  It was in absolutely perfect condition. I have used it on battery power alone for 3.5 - 4 hours a couple of  times and it still had around 50% charge. Impressive!  It's fast, responsive and was easy to set up. It's a little on the heavy side at 7.25 pounds and it gets warm when setting on my lap but overall, I really like this computer."
5.0,Excellent quality.,I bought this for my husband as a gift. I opened the box and did the set up myself (the Cortana set up really helps). It is an excellent laptop! It looked and felt completely new. There is no way I would have been able to tell that this was refurbished had I not known it. It is also very fast! My husband is very pleased with it. What a find this was! I will probably get at least one more for either myself or one of the kids.
5.0,Better than anticipated,"""Powerhouse"" slot load DVD, completely upgradeable RAM and storage, Like NEW out of the box, 4 levels illumination backlit keyboard (automatically turns off when not in use), 4 SuperSpeed USB, SD card slot, eSATA, HDMI and VGA on the backside, separate volume keys top left not part of the keyboard, vents on bottom cover two fans clean and free of dust, headphone and microphone port, quick switch for Airplane mode."
5.0,Performance,"This is a tough laptop. I use it on a daily basis for Finite Element Simulations. Is heavy what i like. it means its not made of cheap plastic like most in the market. I previously owned the Dell M4700 (battery life 2.5 hours+). This laptop, despite it has a new battery, it only lasts for 1.5hours+. I am not dissapointes because of the battery life, cause it has a pretty good processor(i7 4900MQ) and FEM software works great and faster. It came with mechanical hard drive 500gb and 16 G ram (2x8G). I upgraded it to 32G Ram. I use a mSata(256gb) as my main disk (operating system) and a 1tb mechanical Hard drive for storage. It works great"
2.0,Disappointed,I know it’s refurbished but this thing looks like it’s been used a couple years. Wear marks on the sides and it’s missing a rubber bumper on bottom! It wobbles on the table. Very disappointed this wasn’t more new looking.
1.0,Computer repair shop here I come.,"This computer was a workhorse for my mother-in-law and now it can not repair itself after an update. The computer stopped working. Some things are to good to be true. This was the first of two m4800 laptops I purchased from amazon, the second m4800 had hardware issues and I returned it promptly and found a better refurb from amazon’s competitor. I hope this helps people choices. If it still worked this was an amazing laptop for 430$."
5.0,Good value,"Mine came with the 4810MQ CPU instead of the 4900MQ, but they have similar performance."
5.0,Great buy for a i7 processor!,I just received this a couple days ago but the set up went smoothly and was easy to complete. This laptop is a tank but it is fast and a fraction of the price of the newer i7 models with 16 Meg of ram. I wanted a fast i7 but less than $500 bucks so this was great for me. I'M leaving it on the desk so the weight isn't an issue. The whole laptop looked great and in pretty much new condition.
5.0,Like new workhorse,"This is a great refurbished buy.  Mine was delivered very clean with almost no signs of wear.  The keyboard and touch pad look total new so I am wondering if they actually replaced them.  The 1920x1080 display is very sharp and bright with good contrast.  I work with Visual Studio set to a small font and it's very comfortable.  Mine has the i7-4810MQ instead of the spec'd i7-4900MQ but after checking the benchmarks there is practically no difference in performance.  The battery that came with mine easily let's me run 2+ hours.  It's a very heavy and large laptop, not something for the frequent flyer.  Better to think of this one as a portable desktop computer which is how I use it with a Dell docking station and 3 screens.  One of the attractive features is that it is very easy to service.  Take out two screws, the bottom slides off, and you have easy access to the empty memory slots and two drive bays."
4.0,Solid professional laptop for the money,Product as described. Small cosmetic flaws but nothing glaring. The processor and memory is fast enough. Not for gaming as the Cuda is designed for rendering applications. Sturdy chasis and quite hefty (which is what I like). I replaced the hhd with a ssd and plan to move hhd to the optical drive for media storage.
5.0,Good fast laptop with great resolution,"Well worth the money. Had a few scratchs on the bottom side, but not noticeable. I like the fact the DVD drive you just push DVD and it goes into the drive, no door to break or get in your way. Only problem is with the Bluetooth staying connected to mouse, but that is likely a hardware or Windows 10 issue. Good laptop!"
5.0,"Just as good, maybe better than new!","These m4800 laptops really are one of the best  buys out there right now. I love laptops that use the e-port docking stations. They can be upgraded to 32GB of RAM and a SSD. If you do your own upgrades, you'll have a racehorse pc! I plan to use mine for video editing, photoshop, CAD, and 3D printing."
3.0,Not as Advertised,Product processor was 2.9 Ghz not 3.8 as advertised. I had to reinstall the OS to get Hyper-V to enable.
5.0,"Excellent, but check the specs!","The laptop is very good. It is really renovated. Brand new keyboard. The screen only showed a brightness difference in a particular region, probably by a touch stronger than it should. The announced processor is the 4900MQ, but what came is 4810MQ. No problem, because technically the 4810MQ is better ... There is only this divergence in specifications."
5.0,"Item as described, delivered on time.  Responsive customer service.",Fast and powerful. Suits me as a substitute for a desktop.  I had a couple of questions about minor issues and seller was quick to supply helpful answers.
5.0,best value when needing a powerful laptop,"Works just as one would expect of a computer with an i7 processor and 16GB ram. Above average screen clarity. Downside is the weight, size and battery life have improved since this laptop came out five years ago. IMO, small sacrifice for the performance I get."
4.0,Good performance but seems some components make some sound that have me think,Good performance but seems some components make some sound that have me think this feels like old and wear.
5.0,Excellent computers,"I purchased two of these computers for home use.  Excellent computers, very happy."
5.0,Dell M4800,"Got what I expected, nice unit and works as expected."
