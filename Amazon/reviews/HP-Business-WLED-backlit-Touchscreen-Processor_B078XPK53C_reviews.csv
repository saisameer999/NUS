5.0,External Battery and Data Storage,"This computer is very powerful, holds tons of data. I bought it because of getting a great deal on a wonderful computer. But what I really wanted was a computer without a built-in battery, one I can replace without taking it to a repair shop. This one has an external battery, so I'm very happy. Additional information: my screen stopped working. I have to have it replaced or repaired. Will call Amazon about the problem."
5.0,Very light weight laptop. Fires up quickly and battery ...,Very light weight laptop.  Fires up quickly and battery lasts a long time.
5.0,"Amazon price was right, it was delivered on time, and I had no issues with it.","The laptop was discounted and it was priced right. It was delivered on time, and I have had it for nearly a month, and I have no problems."
1.0,"Tried updates and the like, but nothing helped","It was extremely slow at start up. In addition, moving from various applications the start up for each was slow slow slow if it started at all. Tried updates and the like, but nothing helped. Perhaps we just got a lemon"
1.0,No customer satisfaction,"I am so very disappointed with this product.  It was delivered to me in non-working order.  I contacted hp tech support and was told that the pc needed to be ""sent in"" for repair.  HP sent me the prepaid FedEx box.  The PC was returned about 2 weeks later minus its battery pack.  I once again contacted hp tech support.  I was informed that the missing battery pack would be shipped through FedEx and that I would receive it within two days.  A week went by without the battery pack.  I once again contacted hp tech support.  Spoke with a Supervisor.  He stated that there would be an investigation conducted pertaining to the missing battery pack and that an investigator would be contacting me the next business day between the hours of 1pm and 3pm.  DID NOT HAPPEN.  I am so frustrated and disgusted!!!  There has been absolutely no follow-through on the part of hp.  This is a $1500 lap top.  This has been a TERRIBLE experience.  At this point, I would never give a  positive recommendation for ANY hp product!!"
5.0,Loving my new HP,"I've been using it for school and gaming,(league of legends ,steam games) works beyond my expectations. Good product"
1.0,"Missing charger, used laptop sold as new","I just received this laptop and it came without a charger. It was locked with an existing username and scuffed up. As far as I'm concerned this defective, incomplete, and fraud, selling it as new."
5.0,Premium Speed and Easy Set up.,"Easy set up, lightweight, super fast, seems to be a great laptop for what I need."
5.0,Well worth the money!,Great computer!
1.0,Sooo slow,Very slow. Do not purchase this computer. I’m returning it.
1.0,Bad Hard drive within 6 months of use,"I should have returned it after I had it for about a week. It was slow to begin with. Bought it in November of 2018 and just last week I got the boot device/hard drive not found. I'm not in IT, but I'm not completely useless when it comes to computers. I ran every kind of diagnostic tests possible, went into BIOS, system configuration (which usually fixes this kind of issue), nothing worked. I am taking it to a professional to see what's going on. I had it for barely 6 months and I didn't use often at all since I have a work computer. Occasionally used it to watch Netflix in bed, did my taxes and took online bass guitar lessons. That's pretty much it. No reason I should be having this kind of issue. But with that being said, that was MY experience, maybe not all are bad. Maybe I'm just that unlucky."
1.0,If I could give zero I would,Horrible product... after about 30 days the computer stopped working but was after the return period. Motherboard was bad on a brand new computer. Waste of $550 bucks.
5.0,Love my laptop,"I just started back in school for online classes this computer does everything I need! I’ve had it for 4 months so far no problems. I love the touch screen, it makes life so much easier!"
1.0,NOPE,Out of the box the boot time was slow. I figured it was because of the out of date drivers and OS.
5.0,Five Stars,Item arrived on time and was as described
3.0,Average laptop,"Average laptop, really slow booting up."
2.0,Why does a NEW computer run slower than the new ...,Why does a NEW computer run slower than the new one I bought 15-18 years ago?  This is sooooo SLOW!  I still don't have it completely set up!  M.D. Baty
5.0,Five Stars,What a great buy bought it for my wife and she loves the laptop.
4.0,Overall is great!,"I really like my new computer.  I gave it a 4 because it automatically combines storage in the computer WITH onedrive storage.  So if you save ANYTHING to your computer, it automatically saves to onedrive as well. I bought the computer because I have tons of music I use to teach, and to store photos. WEll, onedrive was full in the first week after transferring all my stuff from my old computer.  I couldn't save anything....documents, pics, music.  All the while, onedrive is telling me that the computer is full and do I want to PURCHASE more storage.....not really.  I googled how to separate computer storage from onedrive.  I think it is fixed so all is well now."
1.0,I Have To Send It Back,"I just got this computer the first week of July. It worked great.....until July 10th when Windows 10 did an update (Patchwork Tuesday!!!). The next day, my computer would start up but my background was blank. I was unable to go on any of my programs or even use the startup menu to shut the computer off properly or restart it. It was basically frozen. I had to do control- alt- delete at least 4 or 5 times for it to start up normally. I called Amazon customer service while in the middle of frozen screen nightmare and they agreed to let me send the computer back. She also asked me if I called HP about issue. After that call, I called HP customer service to get more answers about why my NEW COMPUTER would blank out due to a Windows 10 update. He agreed that it was probably the Windows Update that froze my computer then he said HP could look at the computer for $49 for the first month and $14 for additional months. I just paid for a year of McAfee, Office and a new computer (close to $800) and I was not going to put out another $49 for HP to tell me what I already know that a Windows 10 update froze my computer. I explained that to the rep. Then he did a 360 and said well we can't blame Windows and there could be another problem. He couldn't answer why a brand new HP device should have any other problems that would cause a blank screen and freezing. ( I guess you need to pay HP $49  for that answer) I don't know who I am angrier with HP customer service or Windows 10 updates. A brand new device should not freeze after a Windows 10 update!"

1.0,Ultra SLOW Computer,This computer is ULTRA SLOW. A huge disappointment. It takes forever to do simple tasks.  I have given up working on it & just use my cell phone to look up things because the cellphone is much faster.  Now have to purchase another computer all over again. What a waste of money! DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER- IF YOU DO - YOU WILL BE SORRY!
