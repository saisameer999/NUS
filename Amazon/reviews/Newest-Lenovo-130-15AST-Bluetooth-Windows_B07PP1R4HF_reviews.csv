5.0,Choose this over the Acer E15,"I will be comparing this to my Acer E-15-575-33BM (ASIN: B01K1IO3QW) with 8GB RAM and a 256GB Western Digital M.2 SSD. The Lenovo has a very light, slim body when open or closed, and feels sleek but looks plain. Semi tough plastic unibody-style build similar to the Acer. Screen quality on the Lenovo is good but the Acer quality is better. The Lenovo came with Windows 10 S-mode, but that can be disabled to turn it into Home mode which I recommend you do, but it's better to do a clean install to remove any of the excess bloatware this comes with. The AMD A9 is snappy but 4GB ram is a bit bare for my liking, so another 4GB will be added like my Acer. I'm so used to SSDs, it's hard to even pay attention to the quick boot and load times in the Lenovo. In a back to back comparison in regards to daily use, it's hard to discern a difference between the Acer. The charger is about the size of a Nintendo Switch adapter which is nice!"
1.0,Most garbage laptop ever,"This laptop is by far the WORST laptop I've ever had. Within 30 minutes, my battery is almost dead and it was only on the desktop screen the whole time because I was trying to connect to the internet that whole time. When watching videos, this thing is god awful at processing the frames. It's even slower than my 7 year old laptop! I was expecting just a regular school laptop but no, this thing is the worst laptop I've ever bought on Amazon. This laptop cannot even run Google correctly. It's so laggy that I couldn't even bare it anymore. The only thing this laptop is good for is probably typing essays. I need a laptop that will help me watch videos for school and type but sadly, this laptop can only do one of those. I know this laptop is new but come on guys, it's 2019 and a laptop as cheap as this can't function in simple tasks. Returning this thing Asap."
