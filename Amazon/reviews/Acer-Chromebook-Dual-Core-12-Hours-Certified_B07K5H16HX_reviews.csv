5.0,Incredible Value,"Sure, it's nothing like my desktop. But for $150 what you get is simply amazing. When I think I bought my first PC in 1983 with 64KB of RAM, and two floppy disk drives (no HDD) and a monochrome text-only monitor for $5,000, I can only shake my head in wonder of how far we've come. This is a great little machine. Does everything I need it to reasonably quickly. I'll use it 'til it's dead and then throw it out."
5.0,Not bad at all.,"I am amazed how nicely intact the computer came. No ding, scratches or anything missing. It comes with the powercord. It's very easy to turn on and work. You do need a Google account to access it. I've been fiddling with it since it's a Christmas gift for someone else. Battery life seems to run normal."
5.0,perfect for me,Took me around five minutes to get it going fast and easy to use.  Automatic updates and virus protection.
1.0,Not up to speed!,"This is allegedly a 2018 model.  However, it is extremely SLOW and hesitates consistently and often.  I bought this Chromebook to replace the one I bought in 2014 and it is SLOWER than my old one!  Also, the giant search key next to the A key  is so large I hit it about 10 times per attempted use of the machine...VERY annoying."
5.0,I would purchase again!,"Great price and very pleased with the performance for a college student writing papers, researching and submitting lessons online"
4.0,will not work with microsoft windows 7,I could not keep it because I needed windows operating system to do my work but the Chromebook looked great.

5.0,Perfect For Kids,Purchase 3 for the kids for Christmas. Great buy!
4.0,"So far, so good!","This is my first Chromebook.  I did a bit of research and this seemed to be the best ""bang for the buck.""  I'd always been hesitant to purchase anything that isn't a PC because our world is so Windows based.  But my work laptop isn't agreeing with Chrome at the moment and IE is SOOOO SLOW and hard to use with Google (on my machine anyway), I thought I would give a Chromebook a try.  I have a Pixel Phone and tend to use Google Docs a lot for personal use so it seemed to make sense."
5.0,Nice laptop,"Bought this refurbished and so far it has run flawlessly. Two things I did not understand about Chromebooks going in (this was my first). You must have  wifi or you are dead in the water. If your internet connection goes down you have no offline capabilities. Second, if you want to play games, the ONLY games you can play are those in the Google Play Store. I don't watch movies on my laptop, but I suspect my Amazon Prime membership will not allow me to view movies on my Chromebook. Due to these limitations I will probably be shopping for an alternative soon, but given the $200 I paid for this unit it was a bargain."

3.0,"Good product, affordable, no charger included",This is a good product for the price. Exactly what I wanted. But I was very disappointed that it didnâ€™t come with a charger.
5.0,Great product,Bought as a gift for my 7 year old. Very durable!
5.0,Looks New!,"I'd received my Acer Chromebook at the promised date. I was really hesitant about buying a used laptop as a gift. I'd read a couple of reviews prior and had decided to purchase a chromebook from this buyer. Reviews and ratings usually has a great impact on my buying decisions and reviews on this product were good. The price was reasonable and the chromebook's performance is quite fast. You can use docs, sheets, and slides offline. I was worried that it would be a brick without Internet connection. I think this laptop is perfect for a student/anyone that is on a budget."
4.0,Price.......,Takes a bit to get use to google chorme...after using windows 10  It is all about apps with Google
5.0,"Dependable and easy to use, a Bargain.","Outstanding product, will definitely purchase again."
5.0,"So far, it's all good.","It started almost instantly. The screen is big. My google account was there, with all my settings. It felt like I was home again. There's no place like home. The price was so low, I couldn't pass it up. I even applied the 'you get what you pay for' rule. So far, I don't think that's the case. I think I got more than I paid for, just in case you were wondering. The only thing I think could be better is the screen opening doesn't have a space to put your thumb or finger. It's all flush. It fits good, but a place to put your thumb would be nice."
5.0,Like Brand New,"Took a chance and been a week using daily.  Unit arrived and looked factory fresh.  No key wear, scratches etc."
