3.0,"""Refurbished"" apparently does not mean functional.","This showed no visible defects and seemed to work well as soon as I set it up. However I began to notice delays the 2nd day I had it running. I soon realized that the battery was depleted when it arrived, and would not charge. Pages were already slow to open within the first hours I had it, which surprised me so soon after purchase. I disconnected the power cord at the back as a test, and the pc never even started to light up at all. The little battery icon at the top left of the keyboard simply flashes as if it is charging, but it is not."

5.0,Great Deal!,"Came a day early, very well packaged. Laptop looks like new, fired right up with Windows 7 Professional. It was a fresh install so there is no doubt who the computer belongs to. This will be a bonus gift to my great grandson who is in the process of setting up his new business. I'm sure he'll be thrilled not to have to share a computer with his wife!"
