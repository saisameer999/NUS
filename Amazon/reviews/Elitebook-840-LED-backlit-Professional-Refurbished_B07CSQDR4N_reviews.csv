1.0,Important !!, Before purchase anything watch my video. I bought a laptop. But laptop’s keyboard doesn’t work.  I spent a lot time for this freak machine.
2.0,Is Unusable After Only 2 Months (may be fixable),"I bought this computer about two months ago to use for writing, watching videos, and pretty basic internet browsing. Yesterday I get a low battery warning so I go to plug it in and when I come back it is off. Ok, I think, it died no big deal. Except it doesn’t turn back on. Then I realize it is not charging. An hour or so and some googling later, I have reset my battery and this time, it turns on. For about five seconds. I do the whole process again and let it sit plugged in overnight. Next mroning same thing, I get about five seconds and it shuts off."
5.0,"Affordable, refurbished, as ordered.","Arrived in perfect (refurbished) condition.  No scratches dents or dings,brand new charger.  Charges fast.  I get about 5 1/2 hours battery on it (without power saving mode).  I didn't need anything fancy.  I just do a lot of work on my computers.  It works as expected."
5.0,Perfect machine,"It just didnt come with original packaging. But it looks totally new to me. Even the Windows 10 key worked perfectly. It is a dual core i5 processor with 8 GB RAM and 500 GB HDD. The screen resolution is 1600 X 900. Also a touch screen. Plenty of USB ports, display port and a VGA port. It went through several Windows 10 updates once connected to internet which took several hours. Once everything updated, the machine ran awesome."
3.0,Good condition laptop. Bad condition cable.,Device in good condition and working fine. However the charger looks like it was attacked by dogs. Has multiple tears on it with the actual wire being exposed. The charger should be the easiest thing to fix. Refurbished laptop shouldn't mean a used laptop and misused charger. Didnt even bother fixing the  cable. I expected a cable that is used but whole.
4.0,Looks as presented EXCEPT the HDD is 299GB instead of 500GB,"Though the laptop is a steal at that price, there are compromises. The disk space is lower than what was advertised, there is no USB3.0 port, the battery seems to have been removed and replaced, and the general aesthetic does not exactly look new. Either way, it works. I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,"Hard disk error code 301, smart check failed.",With in a month we got smart hard disk error code 301. Not happy at all. I expected it will run for atleast 6 months without any issue. Please don’t sell this kind of products.
1.0,bad customer service,"we bought this computer a month ago and the power cord went bad and wont charge the computer. when I called tech support, they said I would have to call Hewlett Packard to get this resolved. pretty bad customer service!"
5.0,Little power house,"Very much surprised. Fast start up with no lag time. Includes Windows 10, blue tooth, wifi and lighted key board. Does not include HDMI socket and no external keys to dim the screen. This needs to be done through settings. Aside from that it has turned out to be a very good deal for the price at any cost. Will diffenately purchase another before they are all gone."
4.0,Good laptop that gets the job done for work or ...,Good laptop that gets the job done for work or school. Battery life could be better. Will only last you around 4 hours even if you have the screen dimmed to 50% and performance set to medium.  Lid also seems to scratch easily.
1.0,One Star,Did not even have enough storage to upgrade windows. old version of windows. does not keep wifi connected.
5.0,Great deal on refurbished product. Would definitely buy from seller again.,Great deal. No issues. Worked perfectly from the start. Ordered a second one for my mom. No issues. So glad I found this deal. Came with refurbished windows sticker and product key. Seems to have been thoroughly tested. Very satisfied with purchase.
2.0,Not really Refurbished,"...at least in my opinion, a cheesy job.  Excess wear has been literally masked over with vinyl covering.  Arrived dirty.  Power supply looks new, but is running really hot."
5.0,I got a winner,"I'm still testing this refurbished laptop if it will last. I've been using it everyday for a week now, and so far so good. It doesn't look refurbished at all, except for the added film of cover over the keyboard/touchpad area, which is to cover some wear and scratches I guess. But it blends  well with the original surface. There are no visible scratches or damages to the external surfaces top and bottom of the laptop. The laptop itself functions as well as I expected,  fast and responsive. Everything works well."
5.0,Refurb is worth it!,"I was unsure of purchasing a refurb, but have been completely satisfied with this laptop. Starting up a new business, and needed a separate PC for that, and spending as little as possible for something that would work was important at the time. This laptop is lightweight, clean, no dings or scratches or sticky keys... everything I need to work, does! I use this for email/internet, Word, Excel, etc., no serious gaming or anything like that, so I can't evaluate those needs, but for what I need, this has been perfect!"
3.0,Volume and brightness control dont work,I though this was a great deal for the price and it would have been if computer was in full working condition. Unfortunately I could not send it back because I was out of the country longer than the 30 day return window.
1.0,It did not operate properly/not at all.,I purchased this item for my 15 year old granddaughter to use in class.  We were both disappointed on Christmas  day when it did not work.  I purchased another PC at Best Buys because she really wanted the PC.  I have since returned the subject item and have been refunded.  Thanks.
5.0,Great Deal!,Purchased for a family friend that is a 1st year student in college. The item is refurbished but came looking flawless and the i5 really handles everything well.
1.0,Dont recomend this company or laptop,I bought this for my wife for Military Spouses Appreciation Day. I did not get through set up without it glitching but thought maybe it was okay. After set up it glitched and crashed twice so its going back for a refund....... It just kinda suxs that I bought my wife a POS computer when I am not the best at remembering important dates ;-)
5.0,Muy buena relación calidad/ precio,"Me gusta mucho su teclado iluminado, su pantalla amplia y muy buena imagen, diseño elegante y es rápida"
3.0,Slow,"It works. You get what you pay for....mediocre screen, middling performance and somewhat poor wireless connectivity, but it works. A Cadillac it is not, closer to a K car."
5.0,"Great laptop, great value!","This is a great laptop for the best price! It is lightweight and small, yet fast and functional! The keyboard is very easy to use and the quality of the screen is great! I love this laptop!"
1.0,Wouldn’t recommend.,I wouldn’t recommend this computer.  I got it a while ago. I got it for school  it worked great for like 2-3 months then it crapped out on me. I took it to a computer shop and they told me the hard drive is messed up. I barely put anything on that computer and now I have to pay $200 to get it repaired.
3.0,good quality laptop,the laptop is good quality it works well. the battery is still functional and hold power well. the problem i had with this was that the power cable/AC adapter that came with the laptop wasn't working and i had to purchase another one.
2.0,Painfully slow poorly refurbished.,The laptop is poorly refurbished with just stickers to hide the wear and tear marks.
4.0,Could have been better,Nice computer but some key kept falling out. I had to replace the keyboard after a couple of weeks. Then the battery failed after 3 months. Purchased a new battery.
2.0,You get what you pay for,I generally use this product for light browsing and light games. Overall the product is responsive but there’s quite a few takeaways. The backlight keyboard only lights up briefly which I was quite disappointed about.the battery life is absolutely horrendous to the point that I would not recommend bringing it to any endeavor without the charger in hand. The screen sometimes flickers but overall you get what you pay for
4.0,Great buy for the price,"I love this computer. You may need to set things up on Control Panel to work like you want them to, like the Touchpad Settings, to scroll either up, or down, you need to switch them. The keyboard is NOT lit up so that was a bit disappointing. Other than that, it's a great buy for the price."
4.0,Great for school work,"This has been a great computer. It is light weight and is perfect for smaller games, using the internet, and school work."
5.0,Very happy with this purchase,"Got this for my daughter, and she is very pleased. Much lighter than her previous laptop, and in perfect condition. Great deal!"
1.0,Screen Death,The laptop fan working with screen death look like the BIOS not working please guide me if this can be fixed or should I return this laptop back to you and cancel the order
5.0,Works great,"Already replaced hdd with SSD, great performance"
5.0,Better than I'd expected.,"Arrived sooner than promised. Shows no signs of wear. I bought it for my daughter and she says it's better than her previous laptop, which I had purchased new. Buying this refurbished laptop allowed me to get more memory, more RAM and faster processing for less money."
2.0,BATTERY IS HORRIBLE,Purchased on August 1. Received August 6. Battery on October 21 will not hold a charge. Must have computer plugged in at all times or it powers off instantly. Hoping to get a battery replacement but the sellers phone number is constantly busy.
1.0,Good laptop with bad condition,Tootal laptop is good but Battery is very bad and
3.0,Cheap charger,The laptop was not charged . I first believed it was faulty hence was gonna return it. Turn out the charger it came with did not work it was a cheap knockoff. Bought I replacement from staples for 80$ ..
2.0,Laptop is great but kept getting faulty ones.,"I really liked this laptop. Unfortunately, the first one received had a faulty hard drive and kept making noise, I ordered a replacement and the 2nd kne was great but I realized there was a hardly visible crack on the screen. I really liked the laptop but i decided not to give it another go. Maybe someone else will have better luck than me."
4.0,Good buy for the money,A really fast laptop in very good overall condition.
4.0,"No HDMI port, but other options","Barely used it so far. It could handle the CAD programs I bought it for. So far really fast. No HDMI port made it hard to plug into my 2nd monitor, but i found an adaptor/cord to use with it instead."
5.0,Nice laptop,"Nice laptop, had an issue setting up but the seller was extremely helpful and got it sorted out same day. I would highly recommend laptop and seller."
2.0,BIG TIME - Buyer's Remorse/Purchase Regret,...wrong adapter prongs (intended for international use); replacement adapter dead; original battery dead
5.0,It is brand new!  It looks like and labeled like aircraft avionics gear.,I have not turned it on yet.  I will be crushed if it turns into a dot net POS.  But the hardware is beautiful.  It appears to be New.  Like special.  Care went into the build of this machine.  It has a new Microsoft Windows Pro sticker where the key code is still covered with scratch off.  Call me impressed
