5.0,~A Great Bargain for the Casual User,"I travel a lot and wanted a lightweight laptop for casual personal use e.g. watching shows on Amazon Prime/Netflix/Hulu, checking e-mail, occasional Skype, and general web browsing. I also did not want to pay an arm and a leg for one either. This 14.1 Fusion5 T90 Laptop suits me just fine!."
1.0,"Product is ""weak""; Customer service is non-existent!","I was initially pleased with this computer, but soon became disenchanted! Within a  month of using it, Windows 10, MS 365, and McAfee simply disappeared along with the ability to access wifi and  volume control. I called Microsoft several times and visited one of its stores to reinstall Windows 10, but the Fusion5 drives had also vanished. Fusion5 does not have a ""contact"" phone number (Amazon can't even reach them!) and they did not respond to ""contact"" emails on their site.  The price was right, the product is WRONG!! Purchase this computer at your risk!"
4.0,"Good for the money, easy set up","I am a broke college student and my family chrome book finally crapped the bed so I needed a cheap personal laptop to do my schooling on. At first when I opened the box I was worried about the quality because it's so light weight. Quality turns out to be great, Cortana helped me set everything up Wich I was great ful for because I am not tech savvy at all. It seems to be working great so far, fast connection and great sound. So far so good. If I run into any problems I'll be sure to update."
5.0,Well Worth the Price.,"Does exactly what I require of it. At the price ($205 at the time of my purchase) it offers far more value for the dollar than most other laptops I have seen on Amazon. The full-HD screen alone is a wonderful feature, combined with the 4gb of RAM, a USB 3.0 receiver, and relatively peppy processor (Intel Atom X5 - 1.66MHz) you have a lightweight travel laptop that I'm honestly hard-pressed to bring up a valid complaint about. One arguable blemish in design is the lack of onboard space, but that is easily remedied by way of the door on the underside of the unit, which allows one to install their own 2.5"" HDD. I personally won't be needing to do so, but it feels worth pointing out as I see other reviewers have brought up the space issue."
5.0,Nicer than expected Netbook,"This netbook has a great display, and is exactly as described by the seller.  I first tried a 128GB SSD, and this was not seen at all by the Netbook.  I removed it, and installed a 64GB SDHC card, which was also not available to the computer.  After formatting the SDHC card NTFS on my home computer, the Netbook immediately saw it and installed it as a 64GB D: drive.  I did not try pre-formatting the SSD to NTFS and trying it again."
5.0,"Fast, Lightweight....GREAT!!!","This is a wonderful, small computer.  I can take it everywhere.  It is fast, easy to setup and use and comes with all the basics.  The only thing I am just a little disappointed in is that it doesn't come with a touch screen.  That aside, it's everything I could ask for in a small laptop."
1.0,Caveat Emptor,"Poor quality, came with letter P key not working. Touch pad was tinny feeling, did not want to work on right clicking, sometimes froze. Didn't discover problems til a month after delivery, due to it being a gift for granddaughter for school use. Found issues when she went to set it up for school. Was told by seller that I could return it for a refund, so I returned it. Then they said I waited too long and refused to refund, but returned it to me. Amazon refunded it, minus a late fee. Avoid this product, poorly made."
4.0,Good quality for the price,"I am using this as an everyday laptop as a teacher because it is windows and it is handling the task with flying colors. Battery lasts for all meetings, lightweight, and relatively fast response.  The TF card slot is great for hiding files and folders to keep the screen clean and the laptop free of files."
2.0,Not 100% convinced I made a good purchase,"I bought this laptop about 2 weeks ago and have been using daily. I've been using for internet browsing, videos and typing reports."
4.0,More bang for your buck.,Ove
5.0,I can't believe what a great little laptop this is,"I can't believe what a great little laptop this is.  Very small, light.  Everything I was hoping, the charger is not a big bulky power supply either.!"
1.0,Basic tablet in laptop size,"This computer is awful, lacks most functions you expect to have with a laptop. It’s super slow!!! I’ve stored nothing on it and have excellent internet service but it still takes forever to load internet pages. There are no ports for WiFi connection and/or memory cards. This computer is for searching internet only, not your full usage laptop. I would not recommend this"
5.0,Light weight and fast,MY wife uses this for her quilting machine projects. It's very light and fast. I bought a usb cd/dvd player to go with it since the new laptops don't generally have one. A $25 addon makes this machine purr. There was a learning curve moving from Win 7 to Win 10. All in all we're very happy with the purchase and would recommend the Fusion 5 laptop to anyone needing a new computer.
4.0,Fusion 5 Very Beautiful Sleek Device,"I was very pleasent surprise with the beautiful appreance of this device, I purchase it as a gift."
4.0,Good basic laptop!,"This is a great basic laptop! It was a little difficult to setup only because it was made for the UK but I figured out how to switch it to US everything easily enough.  I gave it 4 stars because I dislike all the bloatware that was pre-installed.  The speakers sound fine to me, again just a basic user using it for browsing, shopping, and such.  I do wish the keypad was lighted.  This is my first laptop and I think it's a great entry level device."
4.0,Great laptop for the price,"I needed a new laptop as my previous Asus was on its last leg. I was searching for all brands as I did not have a preference. I then came across the Fusion brand (which is also the car I have ;)and I thought to give it a try! I am very pleased with the laptop. It is very light and reminds me of an Apple laptopn. The only issue I encountered was changing it from british english to united states. Once I figured that out, everything else was a breeze! I was even able to import my Google chrome bookmarks. I only need the laptop for email, web searching and syncing my google apps and this laptop gets that all done. Nice job, Fusion!"
2.0,Lucky if it lasts six months.,"I really liked it. Until yesterday. Two months after support has closed, the thing will not turn on. Really messed up my work load. I have most everything on Google Drive, but I bought this for one specific purpose, which was scanning. I cannot return it and cannot fix it. I would have to return it to the UK, for heaven's sake. Also, the touch screen feature was actually not a part of the computer. Very disappointing, but you get what you (don't) pay for."
1.0,Not worth the money.. does not charge,Just got this pc for simple task and use. Mainly internet browsing and reading books.. it barely charges and battery does not last. It will spend a good amount of time not being used and charging and not charges at all.. tried buying another charger to see if maybe that was the issue but no.. it simply sucks!
5.0,Great little Laptop!,"I have had this laptop for about a month now.  I am kinda computer stupid, but this was an easy laptop to use.  I would say that this is a great bag for the buck.  It came on time and ready to use out of the box.  I did have to update it right away, but for what I paid for it, who cares.  It works great now.  Good picture quality pretty fast processing for what it is.  The only down fall is the touch pad it seriously sensitive.  I've accidentally moved files around because of it. Just adjust the pad sensitivity and your  all good."
1.0,ISSUES WITH KEYBOARD,"Very impressed by the looks of this beauty considering its low price, however and unfortunately, a chill went down my spine with panic setting in.  While setting PC up with US English language chosen rather than its British default, keyboard started to respond with a mix of letters and numbers instead of just letters that I intended to type.  Decided to return item on the double instead of troubleshooting for the problem, why? it's a brand new item with an obvious defect and there's no need to prolong my frustration.  Other reviewers find this PC perfect, others find other issues, but, I decided to take the plunge not believing the negatives(silly of me) and I really wanted IPS 1080p HD screen, but, I guess I got a lemon.  No wonder others say ""you get what you pay for"" and it is true."
5.0,Excellent for the money,"Its been about a month since I've had this and have worked on it almost daily.  It's a fine little computer for the money.  The track pad is a little firm and cheapy feeling (the plastic used on the whole computer is cheapy feeling) but I use a USB mouse anyway usually.  It's not a computer to take to the beach or out into the field, but for home and office use to and from its aces."
1.0,Poor quality even for the price,I purchased this laptop for my 12 year old to use with a drawing tablet. We put a lightweight sketch app on the laptop but the processor is so slow it registers brush strokes a second or two delayed! The screen had bad backlight bleeding on the bottom to a point that at certain angles the screen is unwatchable! Thankfully we've realized the error of our ways in time to take advantage of the return window. A great price for a new laptop that looks sharp and modern however a deeper look uncovers cheap materials and poor quality hardware that looks reasonable on paper but fails to deliver.
2.0,You pay for what you get. This is very slow computer,First and foremost the charger that came with this did not work!! It was a very cheap charger. When trying to get a new charger I had to go through hoops with Amazon to get one. It took 4 days before I could get a new charger for this to use. Secondly the WFI for this keeps going off I. The middle of things which slows down what you are trying to do. The speed on this is not all that great. I had an Asus laptop before this and it was great. I dont think I would ever purchase a product from Fusion again with all the trouble I had gone through. This is not a touch screen!!
1.0,Worked for less than a week,Very disappointed in this purchase.  I had it for less than a week before it would no longer turn on or charge.  I contacted Amazon and they did replace the charger........that did not work either.  Would not recommend this to anyone.
5.0,Came in good condition and has a nice feel to it,"Came in good condition and has a nice feel to it! Definitely will suggest this to anyone and it's within my budget as a college student. It's rather simple too and just what I needed! There is no CD input, but that's fine when there's wifi to scan through YouTube and email. I think it works well for college and high school students. It comes with a charger. :D"
5.0,Perfect for casual user,Love the slim design. It is lightweight. Easy to set up. The pad is not too sensitive - it's easy to operate. Screen colors are good and sound is good. Mostly using for Facebook and news reading. Good deal!
5.0,Nice inexpensive laptop,"This little laptop is perfect for my needs. I wanted a computer for home use with web searches, flash drive use, Facebook and just general home use. This computer is great for that. The only negative is the mouse and that might be that I just need to get used to it. I haven’t used a laptop in quite awhile. The set up was easy and I didn’t have any issues with it at all. If you are looking for an inexpensive general home use computer, this is a good buy."
4.0,Decent lappy for a great price!,This was the easiest and fastest to set up lappy/pc I have ever bought. It's fairly fast and runs my 1tb external drive with no problems. I use it for household book keeping and other similar tasks and it performs well. The price point on this lappy makes it a no brainer purchase. Good job Fusion!
4.0,Exactly as Described,"I would give this five stars, except it has xbox games downloaded. These take a lot of the computer's memory. I am not a gamer and have no use for them. I tried to uninstall them, but they will not uninstall. Other than that, I love it. It is the size I want and has a large, firm, keyboard. Oh, it also comes with a female voice, Cortana, which I turned off. Pleasant voice- I just don't feel like listening. Lol"
2.0,Read all of what it mostly fine print!,Battery life very short. I misunderstood I thought it had touch screen doesn’t. I have only used it once. I have gone back to my laptop that had a bad video card.
5.0,Great product at an excellent price!!,"Power little item... convenient size, user friendly, fast, easy to set up, works very well with other devices. Really enjoying this Laptop.  The mouse pad takes a little bit of practice when set to US. Other than that, all is great!"
3.0,computer is nice for the price,So far I just received it  and it is really nice. screen is clear and lighting is great. I will update eventually. so far so good great buy. My only problem was that I was promised 1 day shipping and this product did not come on time and there were other annoying mix ups as well. I had to call Amazon and a representative worked hours trying to sort it out which is where the delay in shipping came from.
5.0,Good Laptop,The adaptor is not charging the laptop and I need  new one. Is a new adaptor covered in the the 3 year warranty? Can someone get back to me about this? I don't see anyway to contact anyone. Thanks.
1.0,"There's no PC support from Fusion 5, so buyer ...","There's no PC support from Fusion 5, so buyer be aware. I just bought and having a lot problems with this laptop."
5.0,Fantastic quality!,"I really love this lapbook!! Super fast processing,  zero lag and really easy to set up once you figure out Windows 10. It's been a while since I've had a PC, but I'm beyond impressed. The video and sound quality are phenomenal."
4.0,"... and all steps to get it functional are very easy, connecting wireless network went fast and smoothly","its very light and all steps to get it functional are very easy, connecting wireless network went fast and smoothly. This suits for my use very well and i like it very much so far."
1.0,Stopped working in less than 2 months and they wont honor warranty,"This product was ordered 11/28, gave it as a Christmas present and stopped working for my son 2/26. I ordered and paid for a new charger thinking that may be the issue. I received it yesterday, but the lapbook still does not work. The description of this product on Amazon states it comes with a 12 month USA warranty, but Amazon now says the warranty period ends after 90 days! Ridiculous! I would never recommend this product to anyone!"
5.0,"Good value, no regrets!","For its price, it's pretty good! Battery last about 6 hours off charger, screen doesn't have glare, decent colors too."
5.0,It's a great laptop,"I love the product all around so far. I just got it but it runs great, it's compatible with my studio software, and I'm able to do my photography edits with the programs it has to offer with no issues. Great product for beginner users like myself."
5.0,Great Deal!,I would recommend this item for anyone looking to invest in a good laptop.  My daughters are 10 and 14.  They are able to utilize the laptop without any problems.  I am very pleased on the money that was spent.
1.0,Died after 3 months,"Terrible machine.  Bought it for my mom who only used it for web surfing and email.  It died in three months and just one week after the ""support window"" closed.  Will never buy anything from this manufacturer again.  Beware!"
1.0,Lasted 5 months.,Worked fine for almost 4 months.  Then battery stopped charging. Completely dead with no ability to charge.  Worthless now
1.0,"Terrible laptop, that shouldn't be on the market","This is the worst laptop I've ever used in my life. Don't buy from them. Save your money, and time. The mouse movement is awful, the thing is fragile, and the keyboard configuration has its own issues. Not worth 220$"
5.0,The most important aspect of this purchase is the cost and quality could not be matched.,I purchased the this lap top  for my significant other and to replace her lap top that was on life support. I am happy to say that her response to seeing and now working on your product has made life good now. She loves the speed and and ease of operation. When I consider the price and quality I am satisified that I made the right decision.
4.0,Four Stars,this is just perfect for my grandson. he 7yrs old a whiz kid on computers
4.0,Lightweight affordable laptop/notebook,"It’s light weight, good price and so far all good.  Set up was easy and quick."
5.0,light and very portable,"It is easy to  use. Just takes a little while to get used to the pad and the ""mouse"" but it is loaded with my apps as well."
5.0,Good price and easy to install,"I bought this laptop for my mother. I received it very fast, next day delivery. It is reasonable in price, and everything she needs. The laptop is very light and easy to install. The only thing I have noticed so far is that the power cord is short."
3.0,Good size,This product is good but for someone that is not technically savvy it is frustrating to them.  Also the WIFI will not stay connect to this laptop.  For others in house hold they do not like it that much.  I don't have that many issues except the WIFI issue.
4.0,Decent buy,Good computer overall. However if your looking for gaming or video editing computer Id look elsewhere.
5.0,easy to use,I use this laptop for home internet businesses. It is great.  I have not been on a computer since I retired and this laptop was so nice to use.  Thank you.
5.0,Boom! A cheap computer that works!,"The Fusion 5 is a wonderfully inexpensive laptop offering basic functionality without breaking the bank. I have had mine over a month now and love its performance. For the price, this is a great alternative to blowings the bank on all the bells and whistles."
1.0,Worst computer ever,This computer has absolutely no storage. We ran out of storage immediately and had to buy a 1TB external hard drive. But then the computer just started crashing all of the time. Now it basically won't turn on or will go on for one minute and then crashes and restarts. An absolute waste of money.
5.0,Great PC,"Ease to use, install and it is remarkable, incredible and amazing PC to use, I recommend it to all users"
4.0,Great laptop for the price,"I needed an economical laptop to download Cricut Design Space to use with my new Cricut Explore Air 2 Machine. This laptop met all the requirements to use this program, and is working perfectly for what I need it for. The only complaint I would  have is that it only has 32GB which is not enough to support my downloads and install windows 10 updates! , I will need to purchase a Micro sd card to get more space"
5.0,Really nice laptop,I don't use the touch screen. I use a mouse instead.
1.0,DIDN'T WORK!,THE Computer crashed after 1 day of use.
1.0,A lousy purchase,IThe cursor pad is terrible constantly jumps to a different page can’t type on it. It made writing a 10 page paper so difficult.  Don’t spend your money on it!!
5.0,Works very fast and easy,Perfect for what I use this for.
4.0,Great computer,Loved the computer itself just had a little defect. The first one I received had an issue with the shift and control key. Was able to return it with no problem and the second one worked great. I loved how easy it was to get use to and the quality of everything on it. Would definitely buy from this company again.
5.0,Awesome Computer,The thing I like most about this computer is the size it is so light and thin.  The monitor is very sharp and the colors are amazing.
4.0,Nice sleek design.,"I just received my laptop. I haven't had it much yet. However, the set up was quickly and easy. I like that it's very light to handle, and looks high end. Looking forward to using this laptop to start my home business. My only con is that it's not a touch screen. Just will have to get use to that."
3.0,Jury's still out,Laptop came with the wireless driver out of date.  Had to research for 5 hours to figure out how to fix the problem.  I haven't had this computer long enough to give it a fair rating but it's not the greatest start when you have to fix a computer right when you open it.
1.0,"Stylish and sleek, gets the job done!",Edited: I had to change my rating to one star because after 3 days all I had was a black screen. Returned for a refund.
5.0,Works and looks like advertised. Well worth the purchase price.,Easy to setup. Great screen colors. Love the keyboard.
5.0,"So far, so good!",I ordered this computer to be my work laptop and I like it so far! Set up was a little time consuming but overall very intuitive.
5.0,Beautiful bright light weight Fusion5 laptop!,"This laptop is a quality product with a big bright screen, fast processor, and Windows 10. I am very impressed with its functionality as I have had other ""high end"" laptops, and I would consider replacing my current one with this Fusion5 light weight powerhouse!"
4.0,Good for the price,"The Fusion5 laptop is actually a rather good laptop for the pricing, and the display is crystal clear. The HD portion of the name does definitely live up to the name. The only complaint I have at the moment, is the lack of innate storage. For the most part, however, the laptop seems to run at a high, but stable speed."
2.0,not as described,"if i had it to do over again i would purchase a differt laptop, this fusion 5 is the slowest computer i have ever own, it takes 10 minutes to open the home page and about 5 to 7 minutes for a page to open, in mi opinion it's junk"
5.0,Great price and very nice laptop…,I bought this for my sons birthday and he was able to use it right out of the box. It’s light and looks a lot like a Mac. He loves how eatit is to use. The size of the screen is fabulous not to big or small. I had my reservations about the product but gave it a chance and it was worth it.
5.0,you can upgrade the hdd,the computer works well for my returning to school. the only short fall was the tiny 64gb hdd… fortunately they offered me a free upgrade and really made the laptop a good deal works well and is strong for my applications
