3.0,Not bad for the price,"It is not bad for the price. It runs fine enough, but keep in mind that the storage capacity is low so do not plan to download lots of files, apps, or games, and it is passavly cooled so it will get hot really quick. The usb type C port is great with all of the things that you can do with it, and so far all of the functions of the computer and Windows 10 Home work as exspected. It is great for light use, but if you plan to run a couple or more programs at once or do other multitasking then I would reconmend looking at other options. It does NOT support a SIM or eSIM.  I hope this helps."
4.0,Perfect for traveling and school!,"So to start this off, I'm a gamer. I have a gaming laptop, but it feels like it weighs about ten pounds, and its a massive piece of tech. It has to be so it can hold all of the necessary hardware."
5.0,Excellent basic laptop,So i decided to check this laptop out because my small laptop being the dell 11.6 inspiron with the 9220e was a little lackluster and I wanted to see if it was worth upgrading. Im going to be mostly comparing this laptop to that one since they are in the same price range and are only a few months apart in release date.
2.0,32gb of storage is just not enough for a Windows machine,"I love Asus.  I've had three other Asus laptops.  I needed a small Windows laptop for use with the nonprofit I volunteer for -- I need to connect a mobile printer via USB, which you can't do on a Chromebook (at least with our printer).  For that purpose, it will work fine.  I didn't install anything on it except Chrome, a few extensions, and Adobe Reader.  I deleted as much as I could of the preinstalled files/programs."
5.0,Scary,"Great little laptop. Boots up fast, does what it's supposed to.  Had a black screen my first day and almost sent it back. Went into my bios and made some changes and no more black screen, so I'm happy."
1.0,Hostage to Microsoft!,"Bought this simply to do school work at home. Problem is our school system works on Google and this software would not let me download Chrome because ""Windows 10 is now the fastest."" Spent an hour getting help from Amazon support to try to download Chrome; finally, they connected me to the manufacturer. Asus's response: we can not alter the setup, so in short I was stuck with something I could not download Google on."
5.0,Highly recommend,"I did not buy this from Amazon, but direct from BestBuy; however, it is a great notebook computer.  Mine came with Windows 10S, which is the cloud-based Windows 10, meaning you can only load apps from the Windows Store.  But you have the option to switch to Windows 10 Home for free.  Just be sure to run Windows Update before doing so to get the latest download.  Then you can load anything you want on this little bugger.  I added a 128GB microSD card and load apps there--leave the 32G internal storage for the Windows 10 operating system, which takes up ~10GB."
5.0,Great,I got this so I could do school work. Honestly for $200 it is a good computer!
5.0,Does what it does very well for its size,"I bought this as a second (portable) laptop for limited application at work. I really like the weight and ease of use. Touch screens are wonderful when they work as well as this one. I wish it was a few inches bigger, as my senior eyes don't see details like they did. But that's my problem, not the laptop's. I would recommend this to anyone who has basic computing needs and wants a lightweight computer to travel with ease."
5.0,"QUALITY PRODUCT, JUST LOVE IT!","just a little user-adaptability learning curve... but, overall, SWEET. petite, yet, great screen viewing, silent, LONG BATTERY CHARGE!! STREAM FOR HOURS... recommend! why? because it's like a silent partner that is extremely portable and lightweight. lightning speed."
5.0,Minimal task.,I needed this just for minor school and business also this is great for anyone who just using it for minimal task work dont expect this to play modern games but i did test it for emulators work frekin great.
2.0,"Decent Linux machine, trackpad & Bluetooth don't work well","This computer comes with Windows 10 S, which I cannot recommend using. I believe Windows requires too much drive space and processing power to work well on a laptop like this one. I ran Windows for a day just to see how it would work, but I installed Elementary OS (Linux, Ubuntu) instead and it works great. Firefox runs well enough for everything I do on the web, and some graphics software like Inkscape and Blender work surprisingly well. Performance-wise it's a great computer for the price!"
4.0,"Beware !! Great computer, but the operating system....","I love Asus. My all-day every day computer is a 17 inch Asus laptop. Looking for a tiny, very light weight  computer for myself and my husband for travel, found this 11.7"", 2.2 # computer. Compared all the small, light-weight computers. Realized we DID NOT want Windows 10 S. This computer was advertised as Win 10.  Discovered this computer has Win10 S. What that means is you CANNOT download any program not from the the Microsoft Store.  We had to have our IT guy come in to fix the problem. It is fixable, but a pain. Now we are operating Win 10, so it is now acting like a normal computer.  I can't rate the battery life yet, but it seems to be excellent.  My 17"" Asus has very good battery life."
1.0,Dead out of the box,"Bought this for my uncle who was visiting from out of country.  My fault for not powering it up before he left cause it was dead out of the box.  It will not start up and all he gets is a blue screen with a few options to go into recovery mode, but nothing happens when he selects the different options. I possibly got a defective comp right out of the box."
2.0,10 S not plain windows,Guess I should have read the comments. I wanted this for a specific program and knew I couldn‚Äôt have a Windows 10S and saw it was listed as only windows 10 and eagerly ordered it... just to find out it was windows S which is not compatible with the program I needed! Should be in the discription that it‚Äôs 10 S!
5.0,very satisfied,I read the reviews before I purchased this laptop and I agree that it is a great laptop.  It was easy to set up and I am very satisfied with its quality and function.
1.0,Whats the problem with my battery,I just got this laptop and within a hour of the same day it goes off comes back pn after3 hours . If it is not put on the charger it will not stay on.
1.0,Terrible product,"I purchased this 10 weeks ago for work to replace my MacBook. It now will not work at all. It repeatedly keeps telling me that there is an internal error it will automatically repair, except it seems to be incapable of doing such."
1.0,It does not work,"Only one day it worked and then it is not turning on, I am returning the product."
3.0,The audio quality is not very good,In addition I called the Amazon phone line and specifically asked if the product could be connected to a gateway internet provider and was assured that it could but this was not so!
4.0,Good battery life,For simple tasks this machine is great. It seems to crash and randomly close windows sometimes when surfing the web. Colors on the screen are a bit off but  overall it‚Äôs fine for my needs.
1.0,I GOT HACKED!,I received this computer today and my google account got hacked into.  I sat on the phone with Microsoft and they tried to charge me 149.99 dollars to ‚Äúunhack‚Äù my account. I had to reset all of my passwords. This computer was supposed to be ‚Äúbrand new‚Äù. My information shouldn‚Äôt have been hacked into with it being brand new. THIS IS A WARNING. BE CAREFUL.
5.0,Good value,I just needed something for emails/internet and this is light weight and works great!
5.0,Great value for the money,"Build quality is good, good battery life, runs ubuntu 18.04 great (you only have 2 cores though). It performs well for the specs given. Im booting of a usb drive, didnt wipe the windows partition"
4.0,Runs smooth,Love this little computer it is fast  Great for web browsing and e mail.  Nice for my Strat Baseball game.  Does the job.
1.0,unreliable,It stopped turning on after three weeks only
5.0,Simple but strong laptop,It‚Äôs worth every penny. Great laptop for what it‚Äôs meant for.
5.0,High quality for the price,"Really light, long battery, really fast to boot Windows 10 PC that has held up for several weeks now. As a daily Mac and Linux user, I'm quite impressed with this PC."
5.0,Its okay hope it don't fail me an my business,It was fast i. Good laptop bit its üîã wont stay charged
4.0,Getting out of Safe Mode (s mode) will be a pain but it‚Äôs worth it!,I bought this product for work purposes and it‚Äôs been mostly a breeze setting up. The one difficulty is getting out of S mode so you can download non-Microsoft apps like Google Chrome. Look up video tutorials or find yourself a tech savvy person to help you because the Asus support people won‚Äôt.
1.0,Terrible,"Very slow, speakers are terrible."
5.0,Highly recommended,Excellent for price

5.0,Excellent little laptop!!!,"Excellent little laptop with long battery life, fairly loud speakers and good enough screen quality for its small size. So delightful to carry it around with me whole day for all computing usage."
5.0,Buy a portable hard disc),The laptop is just perfect I love it! It feels like macbook air 11' for me just the screen quality is worse. But  for this price it's a perfect choice!
5.0,Best for this price,Perfect for school and basic work. Great battery life. Don't forget to update Windows S to Windows Home. In S mode you can download Apps only from Microsoft Store.
4.0,"Excelente equipo,muy rapido y versatil.","La √∫nica falla es que trae muy poco manual de instrucciones, sin embargo su configuraci√≥n fue r√°pida."
1.0,Slow,Do not buy this. Plain and simple. Save up another 50-80 dollars and buy a different brand.
