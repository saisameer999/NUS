4.0,Take it out of Windows-S Mode Immediately,"After completing the Windows setup (which Cortana mostly helps you get through), including creating a PIN (not a password), it is advisable to take the Lenovo Flex 11 out of Windows-S and switch to Windows 10 Home. The reason to do this is a bug that I found in the version of Windows S that shipped with this laptop. After setting up the PC which was functioning fine, I closed the lid and came back a few minutes later. When I opened the lid Windows S mode I got the message “PIN is no longer available due to a change in the security settings on the device. You can set up your PIN again by going to Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options code (0x8007054f)” No security settings were changed by me, and there is no way to go beyond this page, so there was no going to Settings>Accounts>Sign In Options."
5.0,great compact laptop for occasional use,"My previous laptop was getting old so I decided to pull the trigger for this one.  My previous one had a larger screen than this one (15.6""), but I decided to go with a more compact route this time, since I'm only going to use this occasionally when I visit my mother.  It is an adjustment having the smaller keyboard (I'm 5'11 and have long fingers), but that's just part of the tradeoff of having a smaller device.  The shift and backspace keys are proving to be the more difficult ones., and I also miss the number pad I had on my previous one.  The screen is also noticeably smaller, but I don't really mind small font.  I've been using it for about a week and so far the power seems to hold up fine for doing basic tasks like video streaming, internet browsing, and working with excel and word processor.  I like the design, it's simple and sleek, and it has a nice, sturdy feeling to it.  For the price of $325, I'd say it's a good deal - I can see myself easily having this for the next 5-6 years.  A few minor complaints is I don't like Lenovo's rounded keys at the bottom and I would rather have not paid for the extra features of it having a tablet mode or it rotating completely around.  I'm not going to use those features."
5.0,Great little netbook!,I purchased this netbook basically for day travel.  It is not my main laptop.  (My main laptop is a Toughbook so I have come to appreciate stability in a machine).
5.0,Perfect Linux Laptop!!!,"Installed Lubuntu on it. Runs like a dream! Can do all my coding and even remote into my desktop at home that runs windows. Portable, light, and great on battery."
4.0,"For the pricepoint, it's a winner.","As an IT Pro for the last 20 years and computer nerd since 1977, I know quality when I get my hands on a device."
4.0,Good Convertible Small Laptop,"I have this small laptop and I am quite happy with it so far.  At first it was slow moving and lagging when I got on to the internet.  I was disappointed at first then I checked on the update and security possibly pending.  Well to my amazement there was a list of Windows 10 updates to be downloaded and installed properly to run this little laptop.  It took over 2 hours for all the updates to done and installed.  I have chosen to stay with Windows 10 S mode because I don't need apps for now on this laptop.  Currently my little laptop is running smoothly and much more efficient when surfing the internet.  It's not perfect, but I am please with it.  The little laptop has some solid feel to it and not the flimsy chrome books and small laptops I have come across in the past.  I do like the Lenovo name brand for laptops because I own 4 of them currently.  4 stars only because it's not perfect but darn close to it!  It's now a see and wait and hope all is well in the months to come and hopefully for years too!"
5.0,Good buy for what it is.,"As a computer hobbyist I was researching possibilities for a friend, who wants to get a new laptop to replace one almost 10 years old. (Windows 7). Works ok as a bulky tablet, but my interest was to find something light, small, and extremely portable. Battery life exceeded my expectations. Windows 10 “S” mode was a disappointment. Too controlling ,so switched it easily to standard Windows 10 Home version. After loading 3 apps and doing a disk cleanup, ended up with 30GB of free space of the fixed 64GB simulated hard drive storage. Video is not crisp as perhaps an iPad, but you can’t beat the price for this device. If it breaks, toss it. Not a great loss like a high dollar laptop might be."
5.0,Bought for my daughter starting College,"Everyone whos tried it, likes it, bought another one for my other daughter starting college next year"
4.0,Great 2-1 laptop with expandable M.2 2280 strage,Pros:
5.0,great pc,"this little laptop didn't have the best packaging bare minimum, but it was totally worth it, the touch is amazing, the battery is ok, and is super light, this is a great pc highly recommend it to anyone who needs a good pc"
5.0,A Powerful Tiny Good Looking Laptop,"This is the tinniest laptop i have ever purchased. I was a bit skeptical going for an 11 inch laptop but this thing delivers and for the price, its definitely worth the money."
1.0,Is not worth,A huge disappointment at not being able to install Linux on this machine that has the proper configuration for this system. The BIOS has a lock to install even though other versions of Windows (the worst operating system that could ever code in this world). I bought the device for portability and for my classes that need Linux. I do not recommend and will advise my students to never buy Lenovo. This is what I can do to keep others from supporting such companies.
5.0,Great price,Great product and price! Just be aware you will need to take this out of school mode!
1.0,Do not buy this computer,Computer did work out of the box. Wifi works only every couple of days and only for a short time. I was deployed when I bought this so by the time I turned it on it was past Amazon's 30 day return. Now I've got a computer that doesn't do anything other than watch movies and that's it. Amazon will do nothing to help me neither will the company
5.0,Great so far,"Have had for about a month, works great so far.  It can handle some simpler or well optimized games, screen looks good and battery lasts pretty long.  Processor can handle using DAW stuff for making music and using controllers too which is nice.  It would be nicer if these things had more regular USB ports but Im just getting old I guess as most dont have this many.  Great purchase, took a lot of research to find this is the best value if you're just looking for another screen/travel computer/audio workstation on the go.  Will update if something comes up."
5.0,Its functioning better thah expected,"I ordered this laptop to use in my studies, as its portable and simple to use."
5.0,Great lap top,Absolutely love this lap top. Did a lot of research & this is perfect! Love the touch screen. Am able to down load some apps. Great for searching the web
5.0,So far it's pretty impressive!,"Granted, I just got this neat little laptop a few hours ago, but so far I am very impressive given just how inexpensive it is ($265!). I got it as a smaller travel laptop and to run Python and Arduino programs, and I think it'll work beautifully for both! I will update this review after I've had a chance to play with it a bit more."
5.0,Great Little Laptop,"I really like this laptop.  It is fast.  Clear screen.  I can't say anything about playing highpowered games on it since I don't play those games.  I use it for email, writing on Word, streaming, and photos.  The chip on my husband's old laptop died so I bought him this laptop."
5.0,Great laptop/tablet,Great product for my daughter.
5.0,perfect for work,I bought this laptop to carry around with me for home health work after having 2 brand new Asus laptops inexplicably die after 1 month of use. I am very pleased with this product.
3.0,NOT Windows in S mode and other gripes,"Although advertised as shipping with Windows 10 in S mode, the computer I received is running a full version of Windows 10 Home, 64 bit.  One point off for false advertising.  The letters on the keys are only decals, so those will begin flaking off at some point.  However, there is automatic rotate when switching from landscape to portrait.  Those two cancel out, so no loss of star there.  However, I am taking off a star for the huge black bezel around the screen.  Such a waste of space."
5.0,great computer for a young student!,"I was debating between buying this or a chrome book, and I'm so happy I went with this. This was a gift for my son and its been working out perfectly for him.  Video streaming quality is excellent which is what we needed.  Great little laptop for any student."
4.0,Great and would've been 5 stars if the power on/off button was on the keyboard,great laptop for the price. very fast but having the on/off button on the right side of the laptop is a PAIN! I'm always turning off the screen when I pick up! please redesign and have the button on the keyboard like the older models.

5.0,Awesome!!,"Love the quickness, Cortona, comes with a year of 365 office, like it's a windows based tablet, light and very happy with purchase. Little more than I wanted to pay, but well worth it. : )"
